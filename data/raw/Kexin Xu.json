Generally, when genetic algorithm is applied to wavelength selection, only how to improve the prediction accuracy of a regression model is concerned. But the robustness of a regression model, that is, the anti-interference ability towards external measuring conditions variance (such as the ambient temperature, place and so on), is usually ignored. Therefore, when the measuring conditions of the predicted samples change, the regression model would predict the measured samples with high prediction errors. In this paper, genetic algorithm combined with experimental design method was studied to increase the robustness of the multivariate calibration model. In our experiments, the training set was divided into the calibration set and the monitor set to establish the regression model. The spectra of the calibration set samples were measured under the ordinary measuring conditions. The measuring conditions when obtaining the monitor set sample spectra could be arranged according to experimental design method. Kennard/Stone algorithm was used to select monitor set samples from training set. The calibration model could be built with the calibration set samples and optimized with the monitor set samples measured under the designed measuring conditions. And then the validation set samples, which were independent of the training set ones, were employed to evaluate the prediction ability of the regression model. In order to obtain a regression model with high prediction accuracy and robustness, the spectral information caused by the changes of measuring conditions need to be considered and those wavelengths which were easily interfered by external measuring factors need to be rejected when the calibration model was trained. In this paper, the modified wavelength selection method of genetic algorithm was applied to the temperature experiments of the glucose aqueous solution samples. Results revealed that not only fewer wavelengths or principal components were needed to build the calibration model but also the robustness and prediction accuracy of the calibration model were greatly improved. This modified method not only makes the regression model insensitive to external measuring conditions, but also could be applied to the calibration transfer between different instruments of the same type.", "pid": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e15153565"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Qingbo Li", "org": "School of Instrumentation Science and Opto-Electronics Engineering", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e15165822"}, {"name": "Guangjun Zhang", "org": "School of Instrumentation Science and Opto-Electronics Engineering", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151a4da3"}, {"name": "Xiang Li", "org": "School of Instrumentation Science and Opto-Electronics Engineering", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f7b288"}, {"name": "Kexin Xu", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Precision Measuring Technology and Instruments", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fd3be2"}, {"name": "Yan Wang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Precision Measuring Technology and Instruments", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1506f6eb"}], "title": "Investigation on reference value error in multivariate calibration", "keywords": ["Actual prediction error", "Apparent prediction error", "Multivariate calibration", "Reference value error"], "venue": "Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering", "year": 2008, "abstract": "Near infrared spectral analysis is a kind of indirect measuring technology, that is, calibration model is established by using sample spectra and the reference value of the interested concentration, and then predict the interested concentration of the unknown sample by using its spectrum and calibration model. Generally, the quality of calibration model is evaluated by the deviation between the predicted value and the reference value of the measured concentration. Reference value measurement error of the calibration set samples and model error are the main error source of multivariate calibration. When there was reference value measurement error, the regression model would cause great prediction deviation. However in practical application, apparent prediction error caused by reference value measurement error is always considered as the faultiness of calibration model. So it is falsely regarded that the prediction error of multivariate calibration model would be greater than that of reference method. In this paper, effect of reference value measurement error on prediction error was analyzed, and the relationship among apparent prediction error, actual prediction error and reference value measurement error was discussed. At the same time, the applicability and rationality of a computation formula was also discussed, which could estimate the true prediction error in a more precise way. It was proved that the prediction accuracy of an excellent calibration model was greater than that of the reference method by analyzing the reference value measurement error. An experiment of glucose aqueous solution samples was given in this paper. In this example, the effect of reference value measurement error on the prediction error of multivariate calibration model was investigated, and the estimating formula of the corrected prediction error was evaluated.

Here, we report that Etk is upregulated in both human and mouse prostates in response to androgen ablation. Etk expression seems to be differentially regulated by androgen and interleukin 6 (IL-6), which is possibly mediated by the androgen receptor (AR) in prostate cancer cells. Our immunohistochemical analysis of tissue microarrays containing 112 human prostate tumor samples revealed that Etk expression is elevated in hormone-resistant prostate cancer and positively correlated with tyrosine phosphorylation of AR (Pearson correlation coefficient \u03c1 = 0.71, P < 0.0001). AR tyrosine phosphorylation is increased in Etk-overexpressing cells, suggesting that Etk may be another tyrosine kinase, in addition to Src and Ack-1, which can phosphorylate AR. We also showed that Etk can directly interact with AR through its Src homology 2 domain, and such interaction may prevent the association of AR with Mdm2, leading to stabilization of AR under androgen-depleted conditions. Overexpression of Etk in androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells promotes tumor growth while knocking down Etk expression in hormone-insensitive prostate cancer cells by a specific shRNA that inhibits tumor growth under androgen-depleted conditions. Taken together, our data suggest that Etk may be a component of the adaptive compensatory mechanism activated by androgen ablation in prostate and may play a role in hormone resistance, at least in part, through direct modulation of the AR signaling pathway. \u00a92010 AACR.", "pid": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fcce72"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Denghui Gao", "org": "Department of Urology, Peking University People's Hospital", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150c981b"}, {"name": "Hao Hu", "org": "Department of Urology, Peking University People's Hospital", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151f2cd1"}, {"name": "Ying Wang", "org": "Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences; Key Laboratory of Medical Immunology of the Ministry of Health, Peking University", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fd04af"}, {"name": "Weidong Yu", "org": "Department of Urology, Peking University People's Hospital", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e1500eef4"}, {"name": "Jianhua Zhou", "org": "Department of Urology, Peking University People's Hospital", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ff73c3"}, {"name": "Xiaofeng Wang", "org": "Department of Urology, Peking University People's Hospital", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fa52c6"}, {"name": "Weiping Wang", "org": "Key Laboratory of Molecular Cardiovascular Sciences, Ministry of Education of China, Peking University", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150ce36b"}, {"name": "Chunyan Zhou", "org": "Key Laboratory of Molecular Cardiovascular Sciences, Ministry of Education of China, Peking University", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f6b624"}, {"name": "Kexin Xu", "org": "Department of Urology, Peking University People's Hospital", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f5ac6a"}], "title": "CMTM8 inhibits the carcinogenesis and progression of bladder cancer", "keywords": ["Bladder cancer", "CMTM8", "Invasion", "Migration", "Proliferation"], "venue": "Oncology Reports", "year": 2015, "abstract": "Bladder cancer is the most common tumor of the urinary tract.

Optical pathlength is a key parameter of the NIR instrument, which has been thoroughly discussed in univariate quantitative analysis in the presence of photometric errors. Although multiple wavelengths can provide more chemical information, it is difficult to determine a single pathlength that is suitable for each wavelength region.

The result shows that the diffuse reflectance decreases with increasing contact pressure under the contact state.

In addition, there are also some ambiguous time-dependent physiological processes, which make the explanation of the model more difficult, especially in the universal calibration. Therefore, in order to produce a model that is related to the actual spectral variation of glucose, reproducible measurements and clinical validation experiments that improve the selectivity and signal to noise ratio of glucose measurement are needed.

The additive noise increased rapidly when the exposure time exceeded a certain range, since the charge-coupled devices of the detector had no cooling system. The noise power spectrum for the additive noise and the noise of the entire imaging system were studied and compared at different exposure times. The detective quantum efficiency was also measured at different exposure times. It was observed that for exposure times less than 10 s, the detective quantum efficiency ((DQE)(0)) is approximately 0.26, dropping to 0.13 at 4 lp/mm and to 0.026 at 8 lp/mm. However, when the exposure exceeds a certain limit (10 s in this study), the rapidly increased additive noise caused the system to be no longer quantum noise limited, resulting in a decreased detective quantum efficiency and a degraded system performance.

Based on the displacement effect between solvent and solute molecules in a solution, the signal at the reference wavelength is used as an internal reference to correct the spectrum of the sample under test.

Firstly, tissue-like phantoms mimicking the optical properties of human skin were fabricated. And then by using glycerol as enhancer, optical clearing effects of tissue-like phantom was investigated. When glycerol was added more and more into tissue-like phantom, the values of transmitted intensity presented an ascending tendency and the total attenuation coefficients decreased by degrees.

In this talk, it is our aim to study the preliminary application of optical clearing to non-invasive blood glucose sensing based on Monte Carlo simulation. Firstly, optical properties of intralipid solutions mixing with different concentration of glucose were calculated within the wavelengths of 1000\u223c1700nm. The transmittance spectra of intralipid solutions with and without glycerol as optical clearing agent were investigated through Monte Carlo simulation. Different concentrations of glycerol were taken into account. Furthermore, the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) was obtained by performing partial least squares (PLS) modelling. Simulation results showed that the transmittance increased gradually with the increase of glycerol concentration, which suggested that the optical clearing effect appeared.

In this work, in order to study the effects of optical clearing, we customized tissue-like phantoms with optical properties of some biological tissue. Diffuse reflectance and total transmittance of tissue-like phantoms with different OCAs (DMSO or glycerol) and porcine skin tissues were measured. Then optical property parameters were calculated by inverse adding-doubling (IAD) algorithm. Results showed that OCAs could lead to a reduction in scattering of tissue-like phantoms as it did to porcine skin tissue in vitro. Furthermore, a series of relational expressions could be fit to quantitatively describe the relationship between the doses of OCAs and the reduction of scattering effects. Therefore, proper tissue-like phantom could facilitate optical clearing to be used in quantitative control of tissue optical properties, and further promote the application potential of optical clearing to light-based noninvasive diagnostic and therapeutic techniques. \u00a9 2010 World Scientific Publishing Company.", "pid": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e15158354"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Haixia Yu", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Precision Measuring Technology and Instruments", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e1500ef3f"}, {"name": "Dachao Li", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Precision Measuring Technology and Instruments", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1510d8ef"}, {"name": "Kexin Xu", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Precision Measuring Technology and Instruments", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fd3be2"}, {"name": "Robert C.

The hybrid diffusion-P3 equation is solved for an N-layered finite or infinite turbid medium in the steady-state domain for one point source using the extrapolated boundary condition. The Fourier transform formalism is applied to derive the analytical solutions of the fluence rate in Fourier space. Two inverse Fourier transform methods are developed to calculate the fluence rate in real space. In addition, the solutions of the hybrid diffusion-P3 equation are compared to the solutions of the diffusion equation and the Monte Carlo simulation. For the case of small absorption coefficients, the solutions of the N-layered diffusion equation and hybrid diffusion-P3 equation are almost equivalent and are in agreement with the Monte Carlo simulation. For the case of large absorption coefficients, the model of the hybrid diffusion-P3 equation is more precise than that of the diffusion equation.

The volume of transdermally extracted interstitial fluid could be determined by a skin permeability coefficient. If the skin impedance which is the indicator of skin permeability coefficient can be accurately measured, the volume of interstitial fluid can be calculated based on the relationship between the indicator and the skin permeability coefficient. The possibility of using the skin impedance to indicate the skin permeability coefficient is investigated. A correlation model between the skin impedance and the skin permeability coefficient is developed. A novel non-invasive method for in vivo, real-time, and accurate measurement of skin impedance within a micro skin area is brought forward. The proposed measurement method is based on the theory that organisms saliva and interstitial fluid are equipotential. An electrode is put on the surface of a micro skin area and another one is put in the mouth to be fully contacted with saliva of an animal in the experiments. The electrode in mouth is used to replace the implantable subcutaneous electrode for non-invasive measurement of skin impedance in vivo. A biologically compatible AC current with amplitude of 100mv and frequency of 10Hz is applied to stimulate the micro skin area by the two electrodes. And then the voltage and current between the two electrodes are measured to calculate the skin impedance within a micro skin area. The measurement results by electrode in mouth are compared with the results by subcutaneous electrode in animal experiments and they are consistent so the proposed measurement method is verified well. The effect of moisture and pressure for the measurement is also studied in the paper. \u00a9 2011 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).", "pid": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f5fd9c"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Renjie Yang", "org": "Department of Electromechanical Engineering", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150f8883"}, {"name": "Rong Liu", "org": "College of Precision Instrument and Optoelectronics Engineering", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150a23eb"}, {"name": "Kexin Xu", "org": "College of Precision Instrument and Optoelectronics Engineering", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fd3be2"}], "title": "Determination of melamine of milk based on two-dimensional correlation infrared spectroscopy", "keywords": ["Adulterated milk", "FT-IR", "Melamine", "Two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy"], "venue": "Progress in Biomedical Optics and Imaging - Proceedings of SPIE", "year": 2012, "abstract": "The adulteration of milk with harmful substances is a threat to public health and beyond question a serious crime.

On the one hand, it can fully reflect the patient blood glucose change level. On the other hand, it can better guide the insulin dosage, and achieve closed-loop control of insulin pump. A continuous detection method of glucose concentration by borate polymer fluorescent indicator is proposed in the paper. The principle of this method is based on the competing reaction between alizarin, glucose and borate polymer. The borate polymer has high specific reaction with glucose, meanwhile reacts with non fluorescent alizarin. The product of the reaction between borate polymer and alizarin is fluorescent, called as fluorescent indicator. When glucose was introduced, the glucose molecules could react with the borate polymer in fluorescent indicator because of the high specificity. This competing process leads to the decomposition of fluorescent indicator into the non-fluorescent alizarin, and the fluorescent intensity gets loss. Therefore, the change of fluorescent intensity can reflect the glucose concentration level. In this method, the fluorescent indicator can well identify the glucose molecules. According to the experiment, we know that there is a high specific and good linear reaction between glucose and borate polymer. The linear fitting is up to 0.97 and the detection limitation can reach to 10 mg/dL. The fluorescent intensity reaches strongest with the optimal proportion of alizarin: borate polymer as 1:3. The reaction of the fluorescent indicator identifying glucose molecules has a good linear relationship, the linear fitting of which can reach to 0.98. The detection limitation can reach to 30 mg/dL, which fulfills the detection requirements of glucose concentration in vivo. \u00a9 2013 Copyright SPIE.", "pid": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1501abba"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Wanjie Zhang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Precision Measuring Technology and Instruments, Tianjin University", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f6f9f8"}, {"name": "Rong Liu", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Precision Measuring Technology and Instruments, Tianjin University", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150a23eb"}, {"name": "Wen Zhang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Precision Measuring Technology and Instruments, Tianjin University", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151f79eb"}, {"name": "Hao Jia", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Precision Measuring Technology and Instruments, Tianjin University", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150bb2fa"}, {"name": "Kexin Xu", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Precision Measuring Technology and Instruments, Tianjin University", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fd3be2"}], "title": "Discussion on the validity of NIR spectral data in non-invasive blood glucose sensing", "venue": "Biomedical Optics Express", "year": 2013, "abstract": "In this paper, the effects of two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2DCOS) on chance correlations in the spectral data, generated from the correlations between glucose concentration and some undesirable experimental factors, such as instrument drift, sample temperature variations, and interferent compositions in the sample matrix, are investigated.

The experiment result is affected by various factors, such as the grime on sensor surface, baseline, flow velocity, mass transfer effect, temperature, protein activity, bubbles. In this paper these factors are studied systemically by experiments and some solutions are proposed accordingly: (1) Make sure the sensor surface is clean before it is used. (2) Dynamic baseline can provide the best baseline location during the measurement. (3) Flow velocity of 10uL/min-30uL/min is supposed to be chosen. (4) The density of protein immobilized on the sensor surface should maintain lower to avoid the mass transfer effect. (5) Higher response is got when the temperature is between 26 \u00b0C and 30 \u00b0C and it is important to keep temperature constant during the experiment. (6) The protein should be preserved with a proper way and make sure it is active during the measurement. (7) The sample should be degassed and filtered before the experiment and make sure there is no air in the pipeline. Through optimizing the experiment conditions, the sensitivity and stability of the measurement are improved.

In this paper, a method to improve the robustness of the calibration models is proposed, in which the information of the matrix background is introduced as a variable into the calibration data and the three-way tensor is used to build the regression model. The idea of constructing regression models based on the hybrid algorithms consists of two steps. The first is to build a parallel factor (PARAFAC) model with its second-order advantage and calculate the scores and loadings. Then a multivariate linear regression (MLR) calibration model is built from the PARAFAC sample scores combined with the reference concentration values for quantification purposes. For the validation and prediction, the PARAFAC loadings are used to calculate the predicted scores with the validation and prediction data sets, and then the predicted concentration values can be deduced from the MLR model. The proposed method has been successfully applied to two NIR spectroscopy experiments. One is a Monte-Carlo simulation experiment of skin. The changes of the absorption coefficients and scattering coefficients of dermis are considered as the variations of the matrix background. The other is an in vitro experiment including glucose, haemoglobin and albumin solutions and the mixed composition solutions. The determination coefficients and root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) values obtained from the PARAFAC-MLR models are compared with those obtained from traditional chemometrics tools such as partial least squares (PLS). The results show that the PLS model cannot handle uncalibrated variations whereas the way of introducing the matrix background to generate tensor data and the regression method based on the combination of PARAFAC and MLR perform better in model robustness and prediction precision. \u00a9 2013 Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences.", "pid": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f8dde0"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Dachao Li", "org": "School of Precision Instrument and Opto-Electronics Engineering", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1510d8ef"}, {"name": "Yongjie Ji", "org": "School of Precision Instrument and Opto-Electronics Engineering", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e15200042"}, {"name": "Haixia Yu", "org": "School of Precision Instrument and Opto-Electronics Engineering", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e1500ef3f"}, {"name": "Wenshuai Liang", "org": "School of Precision Instrument and Opto-Electronics Engineering", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e15162e38"}, {"name": "Kexin Xu", "org": "School of Precision Instrument and Opto-Electronics Engineering", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fd3be2"}], "title": "Optimum design of the micro-venturi for microfluidic driving", "keywords": ["Interstitial fluid (ISF) transdermal extraction", "PDMS", "Structural optimization", "Venturi tube"], "venue": "Nami Jishu yu Jingmi Gongcheng/Nanotechnology and Precision Engineering", "year": 2013, "abstract": "In order to provide negative pressure for the interstitial fluid (ISF) transdermal extraction, an optimized micro-Venturi tube fabricated with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) which has a simple structure and is easy to process was studied in this paper.

First, the basic principles and preconditions for the background correction of single-beam measurements with reference correction and double-beam measurements with double detectors are analyzed. Second, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in different measurement modes is evaluated. Third, single-day and multi-day experiments are conducted on aqueous glucose solution. The results are as follows: (1) short time interval between measurements of the sample and reference is the prerequisite for reference correction measurement with single-beam. The double-beam measurement has no special requirement for the SNR and the sampling time interval. (2) The double-beam design is more effective at eliminating the time-dependent variations. The SNR of the single-beam measurement can be improved by correcting the reference sample, which is also verified by the 2D correlation spectroscopy analysis under the perturbation of time. (3) The predictive ability of the partial least squares (PLS) model based on double-beam measurement is the best for both single-day experiments and multi-day experiments, which is consistent with results of the SNR test.

Methods. Thirty-five samples of human BTCC and 15 normal fresh bladder tissues were studied by RT-PCR analysis followed by computer-assisted image analysis. Results. The level of the MMP-2 mRNA in BTCC was significantly increased compared with that in normal bladder epithelium. The positive rates of MMP-2 and TIMP-2 mRNA were 71.4% and 65.7% in BTCC, and 66.7% and 60.0% in the normal bladder wall. The expression intensity of the MMP-2 mRNA by image analysis tended to increase with tumor grading and staging, which showed statistical significance. Similarly, the MMP-2 to TIMP-2 ratio also showed statistically significant difference between normal bladder tissue and bladder carcinoma (P < 0.01). Conclusions. A high level of the MMP-2 mRNA exists in BTCC, which may function to damage collagen IV inside the basement membrane and the extracellular basement of the bladder. The level of the MMP-2 mRNA is proportional to BTCC grading and staging, which may have prognostic value.

However, the mechanisms responsible for its action are not clear. In this study, we report that in prostate cancer cells, Id-1 promotes cell survival through activation of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) signalling pathway. After stable expression of Id-1 protein in LNCaP cells, we found that the Id-1 transfectants showed increased resistance to apoptosis induced by TNF\u03b1 through inactivation of Bax and caspase 3. In addition, in the LNCaP cells expressing ectopic Id-1 protein, we also observed increased NF-\u03baB transactivation activity and nuclear translocation of the p65 and pS0 proteins, which was accompanied by upregulation of their downstream effectors Bcl-xL and ICAM-1. These results indicate that the Id-1-induced antiapoptotic effect may be via NF-\u03baB signalling transduction pathway in these cells. In addition, inactivation of Id-1 by its antisense oligonucleotide and retroviral construct in DU145 cells resulted in the decrease of nuclear level of p65 and p50 proteins, which was associated with increased sensitivity to TNF\u03b1-induced apoptosis. Our results strongly suggest that Id-1 may be one of the upstream regulators of NF-\u03baB and activation of NF-\u03baB signalling pathway may be essential for Id-1 induced cell proliferation through protection against apoptosis. Our findings also suggest a potential therapeutic strategy in which inactivation of Id-1 may lead to sensitization of prostate cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drug-induced apoptosis.", "pid": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151b005c"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Kexin Xu", "org": "Department of Urology", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f5ac6a"}, {"name": "Xianghong Wang", "org": "Department of Anatomy", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150f0bbb"}, {"name": "Mingtat Ling", "org": "Department of Anatomy", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1503c1ed"}, {"name": "Yongchuan Wong", "org": "Department of Anatomy", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e15188a96"}], "title": "Growth inhibiting effects of terazosin on androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines", "keywords": ["Adrenergic receptor antagonist", "Drug effects", "Prostate cancer"], "venue": "Chinese Medical Journal", "year": 2003, "abstract": "Objective.

To investigate a non-invasive, effective and rapid mode of detecting the recurrence of bladder cancer during follow-up. Methods. Ninety patients following transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBt) surgery were recruited from January 1998 to March 2000. Standard ELISA was used to determine the quantity of nuclear matrix protein (NMP-22) in urine of all bladder cancer patients during their follow-up periods. Urine bladder tumor antigen (BTA) stat test was simultaneously performed and followed by cystoscopy. Results. The total positive rates of urinary NMP-22 and BTA stat test were 76.7% (33/43) and 67.4% (29/43), respectively. Comparatively, this positive rate would increase to 93.0% (40/43) when the combination of both urine NMP-22 and BTA test were adopted. Conclusion. Examination of NMP-22 in urine is a rapid and effective way to detect the recurrence of bladder cancer.

Methods: A population-based, cross-sectional survey was conducted among individuals aged \u226518\u00a0years in five geographical regions of China, via a stratified sampling approach. A structured questionnaire was used to obtain information on sociodemographic characteristics, general health, and past disease, and the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Male/Female Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Long Form was administered to estimate the prevalence of nocturia and rate their symptom bother. The current International Continence Society definition of nocturia (\u22651\u00a0void/night) was used, and a secondary analysis was conducted with the threshold of two or more voids per night. Results: Of the 4,723 subjects contacted, 3,023 completed the interviews (64\u00a0% response rate). After being weighted by age and genders, 57.5\u00a0% participants reported voiding once or more per night and 24.7\u00a0% twice or more per night. Advanced age, higher body mass index, smoking, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus were associated risk factors in both genders. Lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic enlargement increased the occurrence of nocturia in men, and higher parity and vaginal delivery were correlated with nocturia in women.

Despite the wide range in prevalence rates, certain potential risk factors for LUTS have been identified, advanced age being the most noted one. However, the true extent of symptom discomfort among the affected population may be underestimated because of the considerable underreporting of the problem. The objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence, risk factors and discomfort caused by LUTS in China. Methods: This population-based, cross-sectional survey was conducted in five geographical regions of China. A stratified, clustered, systematic sample of individuals aged \u226518\u00a0years was selected to answer demographic questionnaires and the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire Male/Female Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Long Form. Results: A total of 3,023 participants (1,551 men; 1,472 women) were included in this study, and 61.2\u00a0% (61.2\u00a0% men; 61.1\u00a0% women) reported at least one LUTS. The prevalence of storage symptoms (59.8\u00a0% men; 60.5\u00a0% women) was greater than that of voiding (23.6\u00a0% men; 8.8\u00a0% women) plus postmicturition symptoms (14.6\u00a0% men; 6.3\u00a0% women). Nocturia (58.2\u00a0% men; 56.9\u00a0% women) was the most common specific LUTS. Advanced age, alcohol consumption and smoking were risk factors for LUTS among participants of both sexes. Enlarged prostate, diabetes mellitus and lower education levels correlated positively with LUTS in men, whereas higher parity and hypertension correlated positively with LUTS in women. Subjects with LUTS had great discomfort. Nocturia was the least bothersome symptom in both sexes, whereas nocturnal enuresis and urge urinary incontinence were the most bothersome in men and women respectively. Conclusions: Lower urinary tract symptoms are highly prevalent in China and many known risk factors are associated with these bothersome symptoms. However, the perception of the extent of symptom discomfort differed between sexes, and it may not correspond with symptom prevalence. Thus, an appropriate symptom discomfort assessment tool is needed to identify the clinically relevant conditions that warrant treatment.", "pid": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e15142c28"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Dachao Li", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Precision Measuring Technology and Instruments, Tianjin University", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1510d8ef"}, {"name": "Yanwen Sun", "org": "Tianjin Key Laboratory of Biomedical Detecting Techniques and Instruments, Tianjin University", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151d7375"}, {"name": "Songlin Yu", "org": "Tianjin Institute of Metrological Supervision Testing", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1509ed1e"}, {"name": "Changyue Sun", "org": "Tianjin Key Laboratory of Biomedical Detecting Techniques and Instruments, Tianjin University", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15129a3b"}, {"name": "Haixia Yu", "org": "Tianjin Key Laboratory of Biomedical Detecting Techniques and Instruments, Tianjin University", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e1500ef3f"}, {"name": "Kexin Xu", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Precision Measuring Technology and Instruments, Tianjin University", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f5ac6a"}], "title": "A single-loop fiber attenuated total reflection sensor enhanced by silver nanoparticles for continuous glucose monitoring", "keywords": ["Continuous glucose monitoring", "Fiber ATR sensors", "Silver nanoparticles", "Single-loop structure", "Surface enhanced IR absorption"], "venue": "Sensors and Actuators, B: Chemical", "year": 2015, "abstract": "Abstract Currently, the implantable enzyme electrode sensor is the only method for continuous glucose monitoring in clinical applications, but the significant drift caused by bioelectricity in body and the effect of electrochemical reactions under hypoxia reduce the accuracy of the glucose measurements.

However, due to the influence of image acquisition equipment performance and lighting conditions, too dark or too bright background could bring the locally underexposed or overexposed image. This could result in the loss of some image details so as to make it impossible to identity the image and the recognition rate would be reduced. In this talk, the application of image gray level normalization processing can reduce the sensitivity of imaging to light intensity. Accordingly, it will greatly improve the recognition rate of human ears. Furthermore, it has been found that even if the object is stationary, the image matching results still have certain fluctuation changes, which could be caused by the system error. In order to reduce the error, the Background-based Compensation Model (BCM) has been established based on the investigation of the system error brought by the working environment changes.

To improve separation efficiency and save energy, several key parameters of separator were analyzed in this paper. Based on numerical simulation method of computational fluid dynamics(CFD), internal turbulent flow field of VSCC cyclone separator was analyzed and turbulent flows were compared under different flow velocities ranging from 15 L/min to 25 L/min. Then based on the concept of penetration, variation curves of particulate penetration with flow velocity under different particulate sizes ranging from 1 \u03bcm to 6 \u03bcm were simulated. Critical particle size dc, was studied and validated by aerosols experiments in order to analyze the influence of flow velocity on separation performance. With observation of flow velocity's impact on pressure drop, a method of optimization geometric parameters was proposed to improve separation performance of separator on the premise of low pressure drop. Results show that flow velocity exerts a significant influence on the turbulent distribution. When the flow velocity is higher, the critical particle gets smaller and the separation performance gets better. Simulation results show that the critical diameter is approximately 2.5 \u03bcm at flow velocity of 16 L/min, approximately consistent with the experimental result. The theory for calculating separation efficiency was put forward according to the curve. Meanwhile, adjusting the geometric parameters is an effective way to reduce critical diameter to 1.1 \u03bcm under the condition of low energy loss, and to achieve higher collection efficiency.

A multi-scale modeling strategy is thus developed. This method fully utilizes the multi-scale characteristics of time-frequency domains in spectra to prevent information leakage through the weighting projection of multi-scale information to multivariate calibration space, which is successfully adopted for detection of borax presented in flour.

To solve this problem, a combined image segmentation algorithm, i.e. KRM, was introduced as a preprocessing method in this paper to extract the target area from the image.

In this study, a novel non-invasive method based on equipotential theory for real-time, in vivo and accurate measurements of normal skin impedance was proposed. The suggested method was based on the theory of an equipotential between the saliva and interstitial fluid of an organism, and this method was compared with the method based on an implanted electrode. The effects of humidity and pressure on the measurement accuracy of normal skin impedance were also studied. The feasibility of this method was verified by the results of the experiments. The proposed method is expected to enhance the blood glucose prediction accuracy and demonstrates a huge significance for the minimally invasive measurements of blood glucose in clinical application.", "pid": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1509808f"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Jingying Jiang", "org": "Tianjin Key Laboratory of Biomedical Detecting Techniques and Instruments, College of Precision Instruments and Opto-electronics Engineering, Tianjin University", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e15172746"}, {"name": "Kai Zhang", "org": "Blood Transfusion Department, Tianjin Hospital", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150c5a42"}, {"name": "Jia Qin", "org": "Ophthalmology, University of California", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1511b40d"}, {"name": "Xiaolin Min", "org": "Tianjin Key Laboratory of Biomedical Detecting Techniques and Instruments, College of Precision Instruments and Opto-electronics Engineering, Tianjin University", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f920f9"}, {"name": "Lingling Zhang", "org": "Tianjin Key Laboratory of Biomedical Detecting Techniques and Instruments, College of Precision Instruments and Opto-electronics Engineering, Tianjin University", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15129eae"}, {"name": "Da Zou", "org": "Tianjin Key Laboratory of Biomedical Detecting Techniques and Instruments, College of Precision Instruments and Opto-electronics Engineering, Tianjin University", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f5b560"}, {"name": "Kexin Xu", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Precision Measuring Technology and Instruments, Tianjin University", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1514a67c"}], "title": "Quantitative assessment of the effect of cholesterol on blood glucose measurement using near infrared spectroscopy and a method for error reduction", "keywords": ["Blood glucose concentration", "Cholesterol", "Diabetes", "Error reduction", "Impaired glucose tolerance", "Near-infrared spectroscopy", "Oral glucose tolerance test", "Partial least square", "Quantitative influence", "Reference wavelength-based method"], "venue": "Lasers in Surgery and Medicine", "year": 2015, "abstract": "Background and Objective: There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that the accurate measurement of blood glucose concentration can be perturbed by many factors. Current literature is limited in describing the influence of cholesterol on non-invasive blood glucose measurements by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). This study aims to investigate the influence of cholesterol on blood glucose measurement through clinical oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and NIRS. Further, a method to reduce the prediction errors induced by cholesterol is proposed, facilitating the clinical application of noninvasive blood glucose sensing by NIRS. Study Design/Material and Methods: We obtained clinical data of glucose and cholesterol concentrations at specific time points (0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 h) during OGTTs from 115 subjects. The subjects were grouped into: Norm for normal control, IGT for Impaired Glucose Tolerance, and Diabetes. In addition, spectral data between 1200 and 1800nm were collected from 130 phantom samples, which are separated into seven groups depending on glucose and cholesterol levels. Statistical methods including One Sample T-test (OSTT), Pearson Correlation Analysis-(PCA), and Unary Linear Regression (ULR) were used to analyze clinical data and spectral data to determine the relationship between glucose and cholesterol concentrations with the time course of OGTT. Reference wavelength-based method (RWM) was introduced to diminish the influence of cholesterol on glucose measurement and further the prediction error induced by cholesterol was reduced when using partial least square (PLS) model. Results: Clinical results statistically show that there is a strong negative correlation between the changes of glucose and cholesterol concentrations in the diabetes group. The spectra of cholesterol exhibit similar absorbance peaks to those of glucose within NIR range. PLS modelling results demonstrate that glucose prediction is influenced by cholesterol concentrations in a calibration model. Furthermore, a model expression (\u0394C<inf>g</inf> = 0:0356C<inf>c</inf> + 1:0129 R<sup>2</sup> = 0.993) is fitted to quantitatively describe the glucose prediction increment (\u0394C<inf>g</inf>) due to cholesterol concentration (C<inf>c</inf>). The results show that glucose prediction accuracy can be improved up to 38.36% by using RWM when using NIRS. Conclusions: The cholesterol has an effect on blood glucose sensing. RWM is useful to help realize noninvasive blood glucose sensing by NIRS.", "pid": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1508e033"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Jianwei Wu", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Precision Measuring Technology and Instruments, Tianjin University", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151c4ec2"}, {"name": "Ridong Wang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Precision Measuring Technology and Instruments, Tianjin University", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151c9d9f"}, {"name": "Haixia Yu", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Precision Measuring Technology and Instruments, Tianjin University", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1507078d"}, {"name": "Guijun Li", "org": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1506d042"}, {"name": "Kexin Xu", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Precision Measuring Technology and Instruments, Tianjin University", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1514a67c"}, {"name": "Norman C.

However, microelectrode patterning on PDMS to form biosensors in microchannels remains a worldwide technical issue due to the hydrophobicity of PDMS and its weak adhesion to metals. In this study, an additive technique using inkjet-printed silver nanoparticles to form microelectrodes on PDMS is presented. (3-Mercaptopropyl)trimethoxysilane (MPTMS) was used to modify the surface of PDMS to improve its surface wettability and its adhesion to silver. The modified surface of PDMS is rendered relatively hydrophilic, which is beneficial for the silver droplets to disperse and thus effectively avoids the coalescence of adjacent droplets. Additionally, a multilevel matrix deposition (MMD) method is used to further avoid the coalescence and yield a homogeneous pattern on the MPTMS-modified PDMS. A surface wettability comparison and an adhesion test were conducted. The resulting silver pattern exhibited good uniformity, conductivity and excellent adhesion to PDMS. A three-electrode electrochemical biosensor was fabricated successfully using this method and sealed in a PDMS microchannel, forming a lab-on-a-chip glucose biosensing system.", "pid": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1503ef91"}]}
