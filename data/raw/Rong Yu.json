However, so far, direct evidence of the lattice strain in the catalyst nanoparticles has not been achieved. By using aberration-corrected high-resolution transmission electron microscopy combined with image simulations, a unique core-shell structure, that is, a percolated lattice-contracted Pt-Fe alloy core and a Pt-rich surface with a gradient compressive strain, was directly demonstrated within individual dealloyed Pt-Fe nanoparticles and thus provides direct evidence for the strain effect on their enhanced oxygen reduction activity. \u00a9 2012 American Chemical Society.", "pid": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151b8edd"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Rong Hu", "org": "Department of Physiology", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e151751ac"}, {"name": "Constance Lay-Lay Saw", "org": "Department of Pharmaceutics", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150a5d5d"}, {"name": "Rong Yu", "org": "Department of Neurosurgery", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1508d018"}, {"name": "Ah-Ng Tony Kong", "org": "Department of Pharmaceutics", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f4cef3"}], "title": "Regulation of NF-E2-related factor 2 signaling for cancer chemoprevention: Antioxidant coupled with antiinflammatory", "venue": "Antioxidants and Redox Signaling", "year": 2010, "abstract": "Cancer chemoprevention is a process of using either natural or synthetic compounds to reduce the risk of developing cancer. Observations that NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-deficient mice lack response to some chemopreventive agents point to the important role of Nrf2 in chemoprevention. Nrf2 is a member of basic-leucine zipper transcription factor family and has been shown to regulate gene expression by binding to a response element, antioxidant responsive element. It is generally believed that activation of Nrf2 signaling is an adaptive response to the environmental and endogenous stresses. Under homeostatic conditions, Nrf2 is suppressed by association with Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), but is stimulated upon exposure to oxidative or electrophilic stress. Once activated, Nrf2 translocates into nuclei and upregulates a group of genes that act in concert to combat oxidative stress. Nrf2 is also shown to have protective function against inflammation, a pathological process that could contribute to carcinogenesis. In this review, we will discuss the current progress in the study of Nrf2 signaling, in particular, the mechanisms of Nrf2 activation by chemopreventive agents. We will also discuss some of the potential caveats of Nrf2 in cancer treatment and future opportunity and challenges on regulation of Nrf2-mediated antioxidant and antiinflammatory signaling in the context of cancer prevention. \u00a9 2010 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.", "pid": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15008c40"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Weiquan Xie", "org": "National Key Laboratory of Biochemical Engineering", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15036452"}, {"name": "Guifeng Zhang", "org": "National Key Laboratory of Biochemical Engineering", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fb3f9c"}, {"name": "Ling Gao", "org": "West China School of Pharmacy", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1502fd64"}, {"name": "Yongdong Liu", "org": "National Key Laboratory of Biochemical Engineering", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150dcf59"}, {"name": "Rong Yu", "org": "West China School of Pharmacy", "id": "5b5433e3e1cd8e4e15f40596"}, {"name": "Zhiguo Su", "org": "National Key Laboratory of Biochemical Engineering", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f6f549"}], "title": "Chromatography-assisted refolding of a fusion protein containing multiple disulfide bonds", "keywords": ["Anion exchange chromatography", "Disulfide bond", "Fusion protein", "Refolding"], "venue": "Shengwu Gongcheng Xuebao/Chinese Journal of Biotechnology", "year": 2010, "abstract": "To establish a refolding process for the protein fused with 12-peptide of hirudin and reteplase (HV12p-rPA), we developed an anion-exchange chromatography assisted method to form correct disulfide bonds. After evaluating various parameters by orthogonal experiments with Q Sepharose XL as refolding medium, we found that urea gradient, sample loading size and L-Arg concentration were three major factors to affect the refolding outcomes, and urea gradient was critical to the recovery yield. Meanwhile, enzymatic activity of the refolded protein was decreased by the increase of sample loading size, and the optimal concentration of L-Arg in the eluting buffer was 1 mol/L. Thus, a dual-gradient of urea and pH on the anion-exchange chromatography resulted in remarkable increase of specific fibrinolytic and anti-coagulative activities of the refolded protein.

The fusion protein, in which HV12p was linked to rPA via Gly-Gly-Gly, was successfully expressed in an inactive form of inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli. HV12p-rPA was identified by sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The expression level of HV12p-rPA was optimized by an orthogonal method and finally enhanced from 12 % to approximate 30 %. We also deeply investigated the condition of renaturation of HV12p-rPA, and the inactive protein was partly renatured through various conditions. The refolding efficacy of HV12p-rPA estimated by the recovery of fibrinolytic activity varied from 0.03 % to 16.6 % and the anticoagulant activity fluctuated in the range from 41 to 2,297 ATU/mg.

Based on the analysis of the size ratio between FVIII and matrix porous medium and its effect on the protein activity, a novel purification process designed was superporous ion exchange chromatography (IEC). The operating conditions of gigaporous and traditional anion exchange chromatography were optimized separately. The chromogenic substrate, gel filtration and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) were used to monitor the bioactivity and purity of the chromatographic products. The results showed that the superporous medium could not only protect structure of macro-protein but also enhance its mass transfer, finally giving FVIII product with high activity. The yield of FVIII in superporous chromatography was about five times of commercially agarose chromatography and the specific activity was up to 154 IU/mg protein. Furthermore, we studied the regeneration process of the superporous medium, washing the column with 5 column volumes of 1 mol/L NaOH at a low flow rate, to ensure the chromatographic stability. This purification process is simple, reproducible and suitable for large-scale production. \u00a9 2010 Editorial Office of Chinese Journal of Chromatography, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, CAS.", "pid": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e150514fe"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Chun Zhang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Biochemical Engineering", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151d5189"}, {"name": "Yongdong Liu", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Biochemical Engineering", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150dcf59"}, {"name": "Dawei Zhao", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Biochemical Engineering", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f82b58"}, {"name": "Xiunan Li", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Biochemical Engineering", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fc9a70"}, {"name": "Rong Yu", "org": "Key Laboratory of Drug Targeting and Drug Delivery System", "id": "5b5433e3e1cd8e4e15f40596"}, {"name": "Zhiguo Su", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Biochemical Engineering", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f6f549"}], "title": "Facile purification of Escherichia coli expressed tag-free recombinant human tumor necrosis factor alpha from supernatant", "keywords": ["E. coli expression", "Purification", "Supernatant", "Tag-free rhTNF-\u03b1", "Two-step ion exchange chromatography"], "venue": "Protein Expression and Purification", "year": 2014, "abstract": "Fusing affinity tag at N-terminus was reported to decrease the biological activity of the recombinant human tumor necrosis factor alpha.

PEG-maleimide (MAL) is frequently used to site-specifically pegylate therapeutic proteins via free cysteine residue by forming a thiosuccinimide structure for pursuing homogeneous products. The C-S linkage between protein and PEG-MAL is generally thought to be relatively stable. However, loss of intact PEG chain in routine SDS-PAGE analysis of PEG-maleimide modified protein was observed. It is a thiol-independent thioether cleavage and the shedding of PEG chain exclusively happens to PEG-MAL modified conjugates although PEG-vinylsulfone conjugates to thiol-containing proteins also through a C-S linkage. Cleavage kinetics of PEG40k-MAL modified ciliary neurotrophic factor showed this kind of degradation could immediately happen even in 1 min incubation at high temperature and could be detected at physiological temperature and pH, although the rate was relatively slow. This may provide another degradation route for maleimide-thiol conjugate irrespective of reactive thiol, although the specific mechanism is still not very clear for us.

Our study is motivated by the following observation. Relaying between nodes seems to consume less transmission power than communication with large distances. However, this well-known issue is not always true when there is an end-to-end delay constraint. Since relaying increases the hop count, transmission rate for each hop has to be raised to satisfy the latency demand. Additional energy cost for raising transmission rate will counteract the benefit from relaying. Therefore, hop count and transmission rate should be carefully set to conserve energy.

In the CMR regime, a strong competition between the ferromagnetic metallic and the antiferromagnetic charge-ordered insulating states is observed. This competition is shown to be important to understand the resistivity peak that appears near the critical temperature. Moreover, it is argued that the system is dynamically inhomogeneous with short-range charge and spin correlations that slowly evolve with MC time, producing the glassy characteristics of the CMR state. The local density of states (LDOS) is also investigated and a pseudogap (PG), identified as a dip in the LDOS at the Fermi energy, is found to exist in the CMR temperature range. The width of the PG in the LDOS is calculated and directly compared to recent scanning-tunneling- spectroscopy (STS) experimental results. The observed agreement between our calculation and the experiment suggests that the depletion of the conductance at low bias observed experimentally is a reflection on the existence of a PG in the LDOS spectra. The apparent homogeneity observed via STS techniques could be caused by the slow time characteristics of this probe. Faster experimental methods should unveil a rather inhomogeneous state in the CMR regime, as already observed in neutron-scattering experiments. \u00a9 2008 The American Physical Society.", "pid": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f5bb04"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Ying He", "org": "Electronic Equipment Institute of North China", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15024c0c"}, {"name": "Donghua Zhou", "org": "Department of Automation", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f94bbd"}, {"name": "Rong Yu", "org": "Information Engineering School", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f790c3"}], "title": "Gradual failure prediction of electronic equipment based on performance degradation data", "keywords": ["Fault prediction", "Fault tree", "Fuzzy neural network", "Performance degradation", "Time series analysis"], "venue": "Yi Qi Yi Biao Xue Bao/Chinese Journal of Scientific Instrument", "year": 2008, "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a series of models for electronic equipment gradual failure prediction through analyzing performance degradation data.

To clarify these puzzling experimental observations, we have studied the two-orbital double-exchange model near half doping, n=0.5, using open boundary conditions to simulate the surface of either bulk or nanosized manganites.

To describe the charge transfer across the interface, the long-range Coulomb interaction is taken into account at the mean-field level, by self-consistently solving the Poisson's equation. The calculations are carried out numerically on finite clusters. We find that the state stabilized near the interface of the heterostructure is similar to the state of the bulk compound (R,A) MO at electronic density close to 0.5. For instance, a charge and orbitally ordered CE state is found at the interface if the corresponding bulk (R,A) MO material is a narrow-to-intermediate bandwidth manganite. But instead the interface regime accommodates an A-type antiferromagnetic state with a uniform x2 - y2 orbital order, if the bulk (R,A) MO corresponds to a wide bandwidth manganite. We argue that these results explain some of the properties of long-period (RMO) m / (AMO) n superlattices, such as (PrMnO3) m / (CaMnO3) n and (LaMnO3) m / (SrMnO3) n. We also remark that the intermediate states in between the actual interface and the bulklike regimes of the heterostructure are dependent on the bandwidth and the screening of the Coulomb interaction. In these regions of the heterostructures, states are found that do not have an analog in experimentally known bulk phase diagrams. These new states of the heterostructures provide a natural interpolation between magnetically ordered states that are stable in the bulk at different electronic densities. \u00a9 2009 The American Physical Society.", "pid": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e1520c7e8"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Ming Huang", "org": "South China University of Technology", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f99155"}, {"name": "Rong Yu", "org": "South China University of Technology", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f790c3"}, {"name": "Yan Zhang", "org": "Simula Research Laboratory", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1511294d"}], "title": "Call admission control with soft-qos based spectrum handoff in cognitive radio networks", "keywords": ["Blocking probability", "Call admission control", "Cognitive radio", "Dropping probability", "QoS", "Utilization"], "venue": "Proceedings of the 2009 ACM International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference, IWCMC 2009", "year": 2009, "abstract": "In Cognitive Radio (CR) networks, spectrum handoff is an important functionality to guarantee the reliability and continuity of the communications of Secondary Users (SUs).

It is difficult for traditional heuristic scheduling algorithms to handle the situation and guarantee satisfying performance in BWA networks. In this paper, we introduce learning-based approach for a better solution. Specifically, we formulate the packet scheduling problem as an average cost Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP). Then, we solve the SMDP by using reinforcement learning. A feature-based linear approximation and the Temporal-Difference learning technique are employed to produce a near optimal solution of the corresponding SMDP problem. The proposed algorithm, called Reinforcement Learning Scheduling (RLS), has in-built capability of self-training. It is able to adaptively and timely regulate its scheduling policy according to the instantaneous network conditions. Simulation results indicate that RLS outperforms two classical scheduling algorithms and simultaneously considers: (i) effective QoS differentiation, (ii) high bandwidth utilization, and (iii) both short-term and long-term fairness.

Multimedia sharing is a promising service in home networks. Effective Quality-of-Service (QoS) provision for various multimedia services is a very significant challenge in home networks due to real-time transmission demand, multimedia heterogeneous characteristics and limited resources over radio interface (e.g. power, bandwidth). In this paper, we propose a Joint Admission and Rate Control (JARC) scheme for the QoS requirements of multimedia sharing in wireless home networks. JARC is designed to support QoS at both the user level and the network level. In particular, JARC ensures QoS provision at the user level using rate control at the application layer by considering the heterogenous nature of in-home digital appliances and exploiting the flexible multimedia processing. In addition, JARC is able to provide parameterized QoS guarantee at the network level using admission control of the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer by accurately predicting the QoS parameters with respect to packet delay and the bandwidth configuration of multimedia sessions. Simulation results demonstrate that JARC is able to flexibly allocate the wireless bandwidth to various multimedia services and provide QoS guarantee for multimedia applications in home networks. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The literature has mainly focused on improving sensing accuracy while sensing efficiency has been largely ignored. In this paper, we propose a group-based cooperative Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol, which concentrates on improving sensing efficiency without degrading spectrum sensing accuracy. The MAC protocol is specified and implemented in three phases: reservation, sensing and transmission. The protocol incorporates a group-based cooperative spectrum sensing scheme. In particular, the cooperative SUs are grouped into several teams. During a sensing period, each team senses a different channel. As a consequence, multiple distinct channels can be simultaneously detected within one sensing period. Then, we formulate throughput maximization problems in both time-invariant and time-varying channel scenarios to determine the key design parameters. In addition, an SU-selecting algorithm is presented to selectively choose the cooperative SUs based on the channel dynamics and usage patterns in order to substantially reduce sensing overhead.

Phase diagrams for three- and five-orbital models are here provided, and the physically realistic regime of couplings is highlighted, to guide future theoretical work into the proper region of parameters of Hubbard models. In addition, using the random phase approximation, the pairing tendencies in these realistic coupling regions are investigated. It is shown that the dominant spin-singlet pairing channels in these coupling regimes correspond to nodal superconductivity, with strong competition between several states that belong to different irreducible representations.

The performance of spectrum sensing is characterized by both accuracy and efficiency. Currently, significant research effort has been made on improving the sensing accuracy. Several exemplary techniques include energy detectors, feature detectors, and cooperative sensing. In these schemes, either one or multiple secondary users (SUs) perform sensing on a single and the same channel during each sensing period. This strategy on simultaneously sensing a single channel by several SUs may limit the sensing efficiency to a large extent. In this paper, we propose a new parallel spectrum sensing. In this scheme, several SUs are optimally selected to perform sensing. During a sensing period, each of the selected SUs senses a different channel. As a consequence, multiple channels can be simultaneously sensed in one sensing period, and the sensing efficiency is envisioned to improve significantly. An analytical model is presented to investigate the tradeoff between the transmitted data and the sensing overhead. A throughput maximization problem is formulated to find key design parameters: the number of SUs that perform parallel sensing and the threshold in stopping the sensing. Both saturation and nonsaturation situations are investigated with respect to throughput, transmission gain, overhead, and delay. Numerical examples demonstrate that our proposed scheme is able to achieve substantially higher throughput and lower delay, as compared with existing mechanisms. \u00a9 2006 IEEE.", "pid": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151c4a52"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Rong Yu", "org": "School of Electronic and Information Engineering", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f790c3"}, {"name": "Yan Zhang", "org": "Simula Research Laboratory", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e15142f5a"}, {"name": "Ming Huang", "org": "School of Electronic and Information Engineering", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f99155"}, {"name": "Shengli Xie", "org": "School of Electronic and Information Engineering", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151d5be4"}], "title": "Cross-layer optimized call admission control in cognitive radio networks", "keywords": ["call admission control", "cognitive radio", "cross-layer optimization", "quality-of-service", "spectrum sensing"], "venue": "Mobile Networks and Applications", "year": 2010, "abstract": "In Cognitive Radio (CR) networks, Call Admission Control (CAC) is a key enabling technique to ensure Quality-of-Service (QoS) provisioning for Secondary Users (SUs). CAC decisions are usually made based on the current traffic volume in the system. However, in CR networks, the system state of channel utilization can only be partially observed through spectrum sensing. The presence of sensing error may mislead the CAC strategy to make an inefficient or even incorrect decision. To achieve QoS provisioning in CR networks, a practical CAC strategy should have in-built functionality to deal with the inaccuracy of sensing results. This paper is motivated to construct a cross-layer optimization framework, in which the parameters of CAC strategy and spectrum sensing scheme are simultaneously tuned to minimize the dropping rate while satisfying the requirements of both blocking rate and interference threshold. After introducing a multiple-stair Markov model to approximate the non-memoryless state transitions, the cross-layer optimization is modelled as a non-linear programming problem. The method of branch-and-bound is employed to solve the problem, where five components are involved: problem selection, reformulation linear technique, simplex method, local search and sub-problem generation. Extensive simulations are carried out to evaluate the proposed CAC strategy. The simulation results show that our CAC strategy significantly outperforms two traditional strategies. The dropping rate in our strategy is considerably reduced. Meanwhile, the blocking rate and the interference probability strictly coincide with the constraints. \u00a9 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.", "pid": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fb8650"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Ruchao Gao", "org": "School of Electronic and Information Engineering", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151c2c1c"}, {"name": "Chaorui Zhang", "org": "School of Electronic and Information Engineering", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151eeb11"}, {"name": "Jiekai Zhang", "org": "School of Electronic and Information Engineering", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f48ddb"}, {"name": "Deyuan Li", "org": "School of Electronic and Information Engineering", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1519548d"}, {"name": "Rong Yu", "org": "School of Electronic and Information Engineering", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f790c3"}, {"name": "Shengli Xie", "org": "School of Electronic and Information Engineering", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151d5be4"}], "title": "Adaptive bandwidth measurement and monitoring for multimedia transmission in home networks", "keywords": ["Available bandwidth", "Digital home networks", "PathChirp", "SVC"], "venue": "Proceedings of the International Conference on E-Business and E-Government, ICEE 2010", "year": 2010, "abstract": "In recent years, digital home networking is popular in academic and industrial areas.

Energy conservation are crucial for WSNs to prolong the network lifetime. In this paper, we study sleeping management schemes which can efficiently control the network topology and significantly reduce the energy consumption by selectively turning off the radios of abundant sensor nodes. Based on the observation that a Mat\u00e9rn Hard-core Process (MHP) could thin out evenly distributed nodes from a dense graph, we propose Backbone Energy Efficient Sleeping (BEES) management scheme, whose central idea is to generate and maintain the backbone by simulating MHPs. There are three attractive features of BEES: (i) the backbone size could be conveniently scaled according to the practical requirements; (ii) the backbone is energy efficient in the point of view of packet forwarding (or routing); (iii) the construction of backbone is robust to possible ranging errors, which ensures the feasibility and reliability in practice. Theoretical analysis and simulation experiments are carried out to demonstrate the correctness and effectiveness of BEES. Numerical results indicate that, compared with two existing sleeping management schemes, BEES provides about 30% wider range of scalability, consumes about 13% less routing energy, and achieves 11% \u223c 20% longer network lifetime under different traffic loads.

In a smart power grid, an efficient and reliable communication architecture plays a crucial role in improving efficiency, sustainability, and stability. In this article, we first identify the fundamental challenges in the data communications for the smart grid and introduce the ongoing standardization effort in the industry.

On one hand, most BAN-based applications involve end-toend transmission across heterogenous networks. Cognitive communication has been known to be an effective technology for addressing network heterogeneity. On the other hand, a BAN is normally required to provide reliable communications and operate in a very low power level to conserve energy and reduce the electromagnetic radiation impact on human body. Cooperative communication has been known to enhance the transmission reliability and maintain low transmission power. However, the joint cognitive and cooperative mechanism has not been investigated yet in the literature. In this paper, we propose a network architecture for cognitive and cooperative communications in BANs. An intelligent mobile device is introduced as either a cognitive gateway to interconnect heterogenous networks; or a cooperative relay node to achieve transmission diversity. Two cooperative transmission schemes, Energy-conserved Cooperative Transmission and Reliability-driven Cooperative Transmission, are presented for different applications that have distinct energy consumption or reliability requirement. Optimization problems are formulated to optimally allocate power in the cooperative transmission. Results indicate that cooperative transmission schemes can significantly decrease Bit Error Rate (BER) and reduce energy consumption, compared to the non-cooperative schemes. The BER gain is over one order in the high SNR region, while the energy consumption can save up to 50% in the low BER region. \u00a9 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.", "pid": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e15191503"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Rong Yu", "org": "School of Electronic and Information Engineering", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f790c3"}, {"name": "Yan Zhang", "org": "Simula Research Laboratory", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1511294d"}, {"name": "Lingyang Song", "org": "Peking University", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f493ae"}, {"name": "Wenqing Yao", "org": "Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fc4be1"}], "title": "Joint optimization of power, packet forwarding and reliability in MIMO wireless sensor networks", "keywords": ["Energy efficiency", "MIMO", "Packet forwarding", "Routing", "Wireless sensor network"], "venue": "Mobile Networks and Applications", "year": 2011, "abstract": "In this paper, we study the reliable packet forwarding in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) with the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and orthogonal space time block codes (OSTBC) techniques.

The channel coding, power allocation, and route planning are jointly considered to significantly improve the transmission quality in terms of STR. The joint optimization design is formulated as a global deterministic optimization and also a local stochastic optimization issues. It is found that the stochastic optimization approach can effectively model, analyze, and solve the routing problem. In order to substantially reduce the implementation complication of the global optimization, we propose a lowcomplexity distributed scheme. The determination of relaying nodes and power budgets are decoupled, i.e. performing route planning and power allocation separately. We have shown that the result in the distributed scheme is able to provide sufficiently accurate predication of the global optimization. In addition, the proposed scheme can clearly reduce the Symbol Error Rate (SER) and achieve higher STR compared with two existing energy-efficient routing protocols, in which no joint design is considered. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2010.", "pid": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150ae024"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Mo-Rigen He", "org": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150b1bcb"}, {"name": "Rong Yu", "org": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f790c3"}, {"name": "Jing Zhu", "org": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f6fd2b"}], "title": "Subangstrom profile imaging of relaxed ZnO(101\u03040) surfaces", "keywords": ["electromechanical properties", "relaxation", "Surface structure", "transmission electron microscopy", "ZnO"], "venue": "Nano Letters", "year": 2012, "abstract": "Relaxation is a most basic structural behavior of free surfaces, however, direct observation of surface relaxation remains challenging in atomic-scale.

However, scattered light may be useful for photoacoustic spectroscopy measurement. In the present experiment, the photoacoustic spectra of an olanzapine drug tablet and its powder are studied. The olanzapine tablet is a weakly light-absorbing solid mixture and its main constituent is olanzapine. In order to eliminate the background signal produced by the photoacoustic cell wall due to absorbing the scattered light by the sample, the difference between the photoacoustic spectrum of the sample and that of its base is taken and normalized with the photoacoustic spectrum of carbon black. It is found that the photoacoustic spectroscopic signatures of olanzapine in the olanzapine table become obvious when the olanzapine table is powdered. This is the result of the internal light scattering effect in the sample.

The quality of spectrum sensing is evaluated by both sensing accuracy and sensing efficiency. Here, sensing accuracy is represented by the false-alarm probability and the detection probability, whereas sensing efficiency is represented by the sensing overhead and network throughput. In this paper, we propose a group-based cooperative medium access control (MAC) protocol called GC-MAC, which addresses the tradeoff between sensing accuracy and efficiency. In GC-MAC, the cooperative SUs are grouped into several teams. During a sensing period, each team senses a different channel while SUs in the same team perform the joint detection on the targeted channel. The sensing process will not stop unless an available channel is discovered. To reduce the sensing overhead, an SU-selecting algorithm is presented to choose selectively the cooperative SUs based on the channel dynamics and usage patterns. Then, an analytical model is built to study the sensing accuracy-efficiency tradeoff under two types of channel conditions: a time-invariant channel and a time-varying channel.

Another suggests that these phenomena are the result of weakly interacting electron states that lie on nested Fermi surfaces. Here we address the issue by comparing the newly discovered alkaline iron selenide superconductors, which exhibit no Fermi-surface nesting, to their iron pnictide counterparts. We show that the strong-coupling approach leads to similar pairing amplitudes in these materials, despite their different Fermi surfaces. We also find that the pairing amplitudes are largest at the boundary between electronic localization and itinerancy, suggesting that new superconductors might be found in materials with similar characteristics.\u00a9 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.", "pid": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15032642"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Yue Lai", "org": "School of Automation", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fc9703"}, {"name": "Jiawen Kang", "org": "School of Automation", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f6f4c3"}, {"name": "Rong Yu", "org": "School of Automation", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f790c3"}], "title": "Efficient and secure resource management in home M2M networks", "venue": "International Journal of Distributed Sensor Networks", "year": 2013, "abstract": "In recent years, M2M networking is an active research topic in both academic and industrial fields.

Scattered light, which used to be a main error source in conventional absorption spectroscopy, is not a problem for PAS, and furthermore, in this paper it is helpful for photoacoustic spectroscopy measurement. In this work, the photoacoustic spectra of an olanzapine tablet and its powder have been investigated. Differential analysis was used to eliminate the background signal generated by the photoacoustic cell. It is found that the photoacoustic spectrum of olanzapine in the powdered olanzapine tablet has the same spectral features as that of the pure olanzapine powder, while the photoacoustic spectrum of the olanzapine tablet does not have, although the ingredients in both are completely the same. This phenomenon can be interpreted as the light scattering effects in the powdered olanzapine tablet. The light scattering effects in a solid mixture amplify the photoacoustic spectral features of the main light-absorbing ingredient in the mixture, rather than enhance the measured photoacoustic signal over the whole measured wavelength range, which is different from the influence of light scattering effects on a single-ingredient solid powder.

Due to the microstructural complexity of these superconductors, the role of the 245 phase in the development of the superconductivity has been a puzzle. Here we demonstrate a comprehensive high-pressure study on the insulating samples with pure 245 phase and biphasic SC samples. We find that the insulating behavior can be completely suppressed by pressure in the insulating samples and also identify an intermediate metallic (M\u2032) state. The Mott insulating (MI) state of the 245 phase and the M\u2032 state coexist over a significant range of pressure up to \u223c10 GPa, the same pressure at which the superconductivity of the SC samples vanishes. Our results reveal the M\u2032 state as a pathway that connects the insulating and SC phases of the alkaline iron selenides and indicate that the coexistence and interplay between the MI and M\u2032 states is a necessary condition for superconductivity.

Therefore, implementation of coordinated PHEVs charging becomes necessary for smart grid. For maintaining the household load, the limited energy supply may not fulfill all PHEVs charging load at any time. Thus, the fairness of energy scheduling among PHEVs should be considered. In this paper, charging fairness (CF) and discouraging-charging fairness (DCF) are proposed to guarantee the charging opportunity of each PHEV and fast recovery of PHEV driving ability. We formulate the problem of the fair energy scheduling in residential distribution network as a Semi Markov Decision Process (SMDP).

Because the sensing ability of a single secondary vehicular user (SVU) is affected by high mobility, dynamic topology, and unreliable wireless environment, collaborative sensing is developed to increase the sensing accuracy and efficiency. Generally, the synchronization is required in the collaborative sensing in CVN. However, it is difficult to keep all SVUs synchronized with others for sensing under the high dynamic network topology, and the sensing overhead of the synchronous cooperative action may be significant. In this paper, we first propose an asynchronous cooperative sensing scheme in which each SVU provides an energy information (EI) that is tagged with location and time information. The sensing decision will be made on account of the EI. Considering the temporal and spatial diversities of each SVU, we assign different weights to each EI and formulate the probabilities of detection and false alarm as the optimization problems to find the optimal weight of each EI. Then, based on the asynchronous sensing, the specifications of the opportunistic spectrum access mechanism are elaborated in both centralized and decentralized CVNs for the sake of practical implementation. We analyze the system performance in terms of achievable throughput and transmission delay.

The peptide fragments of HV12p-rPA digested with trypsin were identified by LC-ESI-MS/MS spectrometry and the results indicated that the fusion protein contained r-PA. Then, the peptides of HV12p-rPA digested with chymotrypsin were identified by the same method. The results indicated that the fusion protein contained HV12p and the linker-containing peptide, DEGGGSY. MASDF and LDWIRDNMRP were identified as the N-terminal and C-terminal containing peptides in the chymotryptic digest mixture of the fusion protein. All of the Xcorr values exceeded 1.5, some of which were above 3.0, showing that the results were correct and credible and a sequence coverage of 85% was achieved. HPLC/MS analysis coupled with uncompleted digestion indicated that all these peptides were arranged with the correct order as expected.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influences of Ad-aMMP-2 cDNA transfection on human proliferating hemangioma growth in nude mice. DESIGN, TIME AND SETTING: A randomized, grouping, and controlled observation was performed in West China Hospital of Sichuan University between August 2003 and September 2004. MATERIALS: Eighteen BALB/c-nu/nu nude mice, weighing approximately 20 g, were included. Cavernous hemangioma specimen pathologically confirmed as proliferating hemangioma was resected from one 52-day-old female child patient. METHODS: The freshly resected human proliferating hemangioma specimen was sliced into small pieces with a size of 5 mmx 4 mmx3 mm and subcutaneously implanted into the back of 18 nude mice within 1 hour to develop mouse models of hemangioma. Forty-five days after hemangioma implantation, 15 successful hemangioma nude mice were treated by intratumoral administration of adenovirus green fluorescent protein (Ad-GFP, n = 5, Ad-GFP group), adenovirus-active MMP-2 (n = 5, Ad-aMMP-2 group), or the same amount of phosphate buffered saline (PBS, = 5, control group). Intratumoral administration was performed once every other day, for a total of 4 times. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Observation of tumor volume and comparison of tumor necrosis area among 3 groups; detection of GFP expression in nude mouse; gross, hematoxylin-eosin staining, and transmission electron microscope observation of tumor tissue morphology; determination of MMP-2 cDNA expression and microvascular density by immunohistochemistry; and detection of growth cycle and apoptosis of tumor cells by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Circled digit one; Ad-aMMP-2 could inhibit hemangioma growth in vivo, without marked adverse reactions. Tumor necrosis of different degrees was found in each group, and tumor necrosis area was significantly greater in the Ad-aMMP-2 group than in the control and Ad-GFP groups (P < 0.01). Circled digit two; Histological sections displayed GFP gene expression in the Ad-GFP group. Circled digit three; Gross observation results revealed relatively large tumor tissue in the control and Ad-GFP groups and relatively small tumor tissue in the Ad-aMMP-2 group. Hematoxylin-eosin staining results showed that in the control and Ad-GFP groups, endothelial cells aggregated together in strip-shaped or lump-shaped appearance, and in the Ad-aMMP-2 group, there were many necrotic foci arranging in lamellar-shape appearance. Transmission electron microscope results revealed vascular endothelial cells with normal morphology in the control group and tumor cells with apparent nucleoli in the Ad-GFP group, while in the Ad-aMMP-2 group, some vascular endothelial cells exhibited chromatin pycnosis in the nucleus, forming apoptotic bodies. Circled digit four; MMP-2 expression and microvascular density were significantly reduced in the Ad-aMMP-2 group than in the Ad-GFP and control groups (P < 0.05).

It is difficult to resect keloids entirely and maintain a satisfactory pinnal shape. Surgical excision in combination with radiotherapy is considered to be the most efficacious treatment available for severe keloids. This study was conducted to evaluate the treatment of aural keloids with intralesional excision and immediate postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy. Methods: Forty-six patients with a combined total of 74 aural keloids were treated by intralesional excision and immediate postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy. All patients received a total dose of 20 Gy in 10 consecutive days. The time interval between keloid excision and delivery of the first radiotherapy fraction was <24 hours in all cases. The median follow-up was 2.2 years. Results: Twenty-nine patients with 48 keloids (64.9%) were highly satisfied with their outcome, and were rated as good by the surgeon. Six patients with 12 keloids (16.2%) showed general satisfaction but wanted aesthetic refinement, and these patients were rated as fair by the surgeon. Three patients with four keloids (5.4%) showed no evidence of recurrence after surgery, but disliked the result because of the discoloration and irregularity of the scar surface. These patients were rated as poor by the surgeon. Partial recurrence occurred in 8 patients with 10 keloids (13.5%). No major complications were observed. Conclusion: Intralesional excision and immediate postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy is well tolerated and very effective in preventing recurrence of aural region keloids.", "pid": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150c1bbf"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Lan Liang", "org": "West China School of Pharmacy", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f815c0"}, {"name": "Rong Yu", "org": "West China School of Pharmacy", "id": "5b5433e3e1cd8e4e15f40596"}, {"name": "Xuan Deng", "org": "West China School of Pharmacy", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1509e257"}, {"name": "Lei Li", "org": "West China School of Pharmacy", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fab056"}, {"name": "Wu-Tong Wu", "org": "School of Pharmaceutical University", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fc59e7"}], "title": "The renaturation of a fusion protein HV12p-rPA by dialysis in vitro", "keywords": ["Dialysis", "HV12p-rPA", "Inclusin bodies", "Oxidation", "Refolding"], "venue": "Pharmaceutical Biotechnology", "year": 2009, "abstract": "The purpose of the study is to explore the refolding protocal for the fusion protein of 12 peptide of hirudin and reteplase (HV12p-rPA) expressed in E. coli in vitro.

Enhanced transporter expression is neuroprotective. In the present study, we tested the neuropotective effects of maslinic acid, a natural product from the Olea europaea plant, on cultures of primary neurons from the cerebral cortex. Studies showed that astrocyte-conditioned medium from maslinic acid-treated astrocytes dose-dependently promoted neuron survival during glutamate toxicity by enhancing extracellular glutamate clearance. Real-time PCR and western blot analysis revealed that maslinic acid pre-treatment significantly increased the expression of GLAST and GLT-1 at the protein and mRNA levels. In addition, this neuroprotection was abolished by the glutamate transporter inhibitor, L-Threohydroxy aspartate (THA), in a co-culture of astrocytes and neurons. These findings suggest that maslinic acid regulates the extracellular glutamate concentration by increasing the expression of astrocytic glutamate transporters, which may, in turn, provide neuroprotection. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier B.V. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Methods/Findings: A total of 30 previously published eligible studies including 1,830 cases were identified and included in this meta-analysis. Wild-type form of p53 status (low expression of p53 protein and/or wild-type p53 gene) was associated with pathologic response in rectal cancer patients who received neoadjuvant radiation-based therapy (good response: risk ratio [RR] = 1.30; 95% confidence intervals [CI] = 1.14-1.49; p<0.001; complete response RR = 1.65; 95% CI = 1.19-2.30; p = 0.003; poor response RR = 0.85; 95% CI = 0.75-0.96; p = 0.007). In further stratified analyses, this association remained for sub-groups of good and poor response in neoadjuvant radiotherapy (RT) setting, good and complete response in chemoradiotherapy (CRT) setting. And the association between response and the presence of p53 gene mutations was stronger than that between response and protein positivity. Conclusion: The results of the present meta-analysis indicate that P53 status is a predictive factor for response in rectal cancer patient undergoing neoadjuvant radiation-based therapy. \u00a9 2012 Chen et al.", "pid": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f9cc29"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Pengfei Wen", "org": "Departments of Dermatology and Plastic Surgery", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1511e914"}, {"name": "Rong Yu", "org": "Departments of Dermatology and Plastic Surgery", "id": "5b5433e3e1cd8e4e15f40596"}, {"name": "Lin Wang", "org": "Departments of Dermatology and Plastic Surgery", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150e7ac7"}], "title": "Atrophic dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans: A case report", "venue": "International Journal of Dermatology", "year": 2013, "pid": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f71bb0"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Yong Liu", "org": "Department of Burn and Plastic Surgery", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1515ba8d"}, {"name": "Jun-Jie Chen", "org": "Department of Burn and Plastic Surgery", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f97fe5"}, {"name": "Nicolas Crook", "org": "Department of Burn and Plastic Surgery", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e15100242"}, {"name": "Rong Yu", "org": "Department of Burn and Plastic Surgery", "id": "5b5433e3e1cd8e4e15f40596"}, {"name": "Xue-Wen Xu", "org": "Department of Burn and Plastic Surgery", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1501d49a"}, {"name": "Ying Cen", "org": "Department of Burn and Plastic Surgery", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150ac7de"}], "title": "Epidemiologic investigation of burns in the elderly in Sichuan Province", "keywords": ["Burn prevention", "Elderly burns", "Epidemiology"], "venue": "Burns", "year": 2013, "abstract": "Objective: This study analysed the epidemiology of burns in the elderly in Sichuan Province, China, with the objective of formulating a prevention programme. Methods: A retrospective review of elderly patients admitted to the Burn Centre of West China Hospital during 2003-2009 was performed, including patient demographics, education and burn aetiology. Results: A total of 103 patients, mean age 69.5 years (range 60-95 years; 58 male, 45 female) were admitted. The most common causes of burn were flames (51.5%), scalding (37.9%), electrical (4.9%) and chemical (2.9%), respectively. The majority occurred at home (68.9%), principally in the kitchen (35.9%), while 19.4% occurred in the workplace. Burns with total body surface area (TBSA) of 0-10% accounted for 52.5% of those admitted for treatment; 10-30% TBSA burns accounted for 20.3%; 30-50% TBSA burns accounted for 15.5%; and burns with a TBSA >50% accounted for 11.7%. Only 6% of patients received appropriate first aid, and 32% did not receive treatment until more than 24 h after injury. The education level was lower in the rural group. Both urban and rural groups had little knowledge of first aid for burns. Conclusions: Burn-prevention programmes should promote improved living conditions and medical insurance, with prevention education for the elderly, especially in rural areas. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI.

Pigs are the most suitable candidate because of the anatomical and physiological similarities shared with humans as well as ethical concerns. However, it may be associated with the risk of transmission of infectious porcine pathogens. Porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) are of particular concern because they have been shown to infect human cells in vitro. To date, researches on the molecular characteristics and potential pathogenicity of PERV are still tenuous. In this report, an infectious replication competent clone of PERV from Wuzhishan pigs (WZSPs) in China was generated and characterized. This infectious clone will contribute to studies on PERV virology and control of PERV in xenotransplantation using Chinese miniature pigs. Methods. The proviral DNA of PERV from WZSPs was amplified in two overlapping halves. Then the two fragments were isolated, subcloned and fused to generate pBluescriptSK+-WZS-PERV recombinant clones. Screened with RT-PCR, a molecular clone of PERV designated as WZS-PERV(2) was selected. Its infectivity and replication competency were characterized in HEK293 cells by PCR, real-time fluorescent quantitative RT-PCR, western blot, indirect immunofluorescence assay as well as sequence analysis. Results: The ability of WZS-PERV(2) to infect human cells and produce infectious virions were shown after transfection of the clone into HEK293 cells and infection of PERV derived from this recombinant clone. The expression of Gag proteins were detected in HEK293 cells infected with the virus derived from the clone by the indirect immunofluorescence assay and western blot. The results of sequences analysis and comparison combined with the PCR based genotyping result demonstrated that the WZS-PERV(2) belonged to PERV-A subgroup. Compared with a previous proviral DNA clone of PERV (PERV-WZSP), G to A hypermutation occurred in the env gene of WZS-PERV(2) was found, whereas APOBEC proteins have the potential to inhibit the replication of a variety of retroviruses through a cDNA cytosine deamination mechanism, so we presumed these G to A hypermutation might be the contribution of porcine APOBEC3F. Conclusions: Altogether, an infectious replication competent clone of PERV from Chinese miniature pigs (WZSPs) termed WZS-PERV(2) was generated, characterized and sequenced. \u00a9 2013 Xiang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "pid": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1517dc21"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Fengling Yang", "org": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, West China Hospital, Sichuan University", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150ef314"}, {"name": "Yu Zhao", "org": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, West China Hospital, Sichuan University", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1507bd8d"}, {"name": "Ping An", "org": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, West China Hospital, Sichuan University", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f5fea9"}, {"name": "Yongbo Zheng", "org": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, West China Hospital, Sichuan University", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f9e94f"}, {"name": "Rong Yu", "org": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, West China Hospital, Sichuan University", "id": "5b5433e3e1cd8e4e15f40596"}, {"name": "Deying Gu", "org": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, West China Hospital, Sichuan University", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ff58de"}, {"name": "Hong Zheng", "org": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, West China Hospital, Sichuan University", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15033cb9"}], "title": "Longitudinal results of intratympanic injection of budesonide for Otitis media with effusion in children over 12 years and adults", "keywords": ["Budesonide", "Intratympanic injection", "Otitis media with effusion", "Prospective studies"], "venue": "Otology and Neurotology", "year": 2014, "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the longitudinal curative effect and improvement of subjective symptoms by using intratympanic injection of Budesonide(BUD) for otitis media with effusion (OME) patients older than 12 years and adults. STUDY DESIGN: A single-blind, randomized, parallel-controlled prospective study. SETTING: Hospital, outpatient. PATIENTS: Ninety patients (112 ears) who were diagnosed as having OME were recruited and then randomized to BUD, dexamethasone (DEX), and sodium chloride (NS) groups, the latter two served as controls. INTERVENTIONS: The randomly allocated patients received intratympanic injection of BUD (0.5 mg/1 ml), DEX (2 mg/1 ml), or 0.9% NS solution (1 ml) once a week. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Survival analysis was applied to compare the longitudinal curative effects among the 3 groups. Meanwhile, the 6 main subjective symptoms were scored by 10-point visual scale, and physician's evaluations were preformed during treatment and follow-up. RESULTS: After adjustment for course of disease, volume, and characters of effusion, the relative risk (RR) of BUD is 0.139 (95% CI, 0.054-0.358) when compared with NS. Survival curve demonstrated that the rank of longitudinal therapeutic efficacy was BUD, DEX, and NS (p < 0.05). Both BUD and DEX showed improvements in subjective symptoms and quality of life compared with NS (p < 0.05). In the aspect of improving the symptom of stuffy ear, BUD showed advantage over both DEX and NS. During and after treatment, no serious complications or sequelae were observed. CONCLUSION: Intratympanic injection with BUD for OME patients showed advantages in improving long-term therapeutic efficacy, it was a safe and effective intervention for adolescents and adults with OME. \u00a9 2014, Otology & Neurotology, Inc.", "pid": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15006b49"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Qiu-Hong Fan", "org": "Department of Radiotherapy and Oncology, Soochow University", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fc5917"}, {"name": "Rong Yu", "org": "Department of Oncology, Suzhou Municipal Hospital, Nanjing Medical University", "id": "5b5433e3e1cd8e4e15f40596"}, {"name": "Wei-Xian Huang", "org": "Department of Gastrointestinasurgery, Wu Jiang First People's Hospital", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1509aae0"}, {"name": "Xi-Xi Cui", "org": "Department of Radiotherapy and Oncology, Soochow University", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e151546ca"}, {"name": "Bing-Hui Luo", "org": "Department of Radiotherapy and Oncology, Soochow University", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1509a5a4"}, {"name": "Li-Yuan Zhang", "org": "Department of Radiotherapy and Oncology, Soochow University", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e1500c8aa"}], "title": "The has-miR-526b binding-site rs8506G>A polymorphism in the lincRNA-NR-024015 exon identified by GWASs predispose to non-cardia gastric cancer risk", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "year": 2014, "abstract": "Gastric cancer including the cardia and non-cardia types is the second frequent cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide.

This study was to evaluate the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) on non-cardia gastric cancer susceptibility in Chinese populations. We selected long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) located in non-cardia gastric cancer risk-related loci and identified 10 SNPs located within lincRNA exonic regions. We examined whether genetic polymorphisms in lincRNAs exons are associated with noncardia gastric cancer risk in 438 non-cardia gastric cancer patients and 727 control subjects in Chinese populations using logistic regression. Functional relevance was further examined by biochemical assays. We found that lincRNA-NR-024015 rs8506AA carrier was significantly associated with risk of non-cardia gastric cancer (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.56, 95%CI = 1.03-2.39, compared with the rs8506 AG or GG genotype. Further stratification analysis showed that the risk effect was more pronounced in subgroups of smokers (P = 0.001). Biochemical analysis demonstrated that the G to A base change at rs8506G>A disrupts the binding site for has-miR-526b, thereby influencing the transcriptional activity of lincRNA-NR-024015 and affecting cell proliferation. Our present study established a robust association between the rs8506G>A polymorphism in the lincRNA-NR-024015 exon and the risk of non-cardia gastric cancer. \u00a9 2014 Fan et al.", "pid": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1515c12f"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Rong Yu", "org": "Department of Interventional Radiology, Suzhou Municipal Hospital, The Affiliated Suzhou Hospital of Nanjing Medical University", "id": "5b5433e3e1cd8e4e15f40596"}, {"name": "Zhi-qing Zhang", "org": "Institute of Neuroscience, Soochow University", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f7ae57"}, {"name": "Bin Wang", "org": "Department of Oncology, Suzhou Municipal Hospital, The Affiliated Suzhou Hospital of Nanjing Medical University", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f6ccd9"}, {"name": "Hong-xin Jiang", "org": "Department of Oncology, Suzhou Municipal Hospital, The Affiliated Suzhou Hospital of Nanjing Medical University", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f6b9fd"}, {"name": "Lei Cheng", "org": "Department of Interventional Radiology, Suzhou Municipal Hospital, The Affiliated Suzhou Hospital of Nanjing Medical University", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e15150c68"}, {"name": "Li-ming Shen", "org": "Department of Interventional Radiology, Suzhou Municipal Hospital, The Affiliated Suzhou Hospital of Nanjing Medical University", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151f3891"}], "title": "Berberine-induced apoptotic and autophagic death of HepG2 cells requires AMPK activation", "keywords": ["AMPK", "Apoptosis", "Autophagy and mTOR", "Berberine", "Hepatocellular carcinoma"], "venue": "Cancer Cell International", "year": 2014, "abstract": "Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the primary liver cancer, is one of the most malignant human tumors with extremely poor prognosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-cancer effect of berberine in a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HepG2), and to study the underlying mechanisms by focusing on the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling cascade.Results: We found that berberine induced both apoptotic and autophagic death of HepG2 cells, which was associated with a significant activation of AMPK and an increased expression of the inactive form of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). Inhibition of AMPK by RNA interference (RNAi) or by its inhibitor compound C suppressed berberine-induced caspase-3 cleavage, apoptosis and autophagy in HepG2 cells, while AICAR, the AMPK activator, possessed strong cytotoxic effects. In HepG2 cells, mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activation was important for cell survival, and berberine inhibited mTORC1 via AMPK activation.Conclusions: Together, these results suggested that berberine-induced both apoptotic and autophagic death requires AMPK activation in HepG2 cells. \u00a9 2014 Yu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "pid": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fa040e"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Yingting Cai", "org": "Key Laboratory of Drug Targeting and Drug Delivery System, Ministry of Education, West China School of Pharmacy, Sichuan University", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15036eaa"}, {"name": "Jingxiao Bao", "org": "China Pharmaceutical University", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fa2bf8"}, {"name": "Xingzhen Lao", "org": "China Pharmaceutical University", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fd2c1c"}, {"name": "Heng Zheng", "org": "China Pharmaceutical University", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151d9b84"}, {"name": "Jianhua Chen", "org": "China Pharmaceutical University", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e15193059"}, {"name": "Rong Yu", "org": "Key Laboratory of Drug Targeting and Drug Delivery System, Ministry of Education, West China School of Pharmacy, Sichuan University", "id": "5b5433e3e1cd8e4e15f40596"}], "title": "Computational design, functional analysis and antigenic epitope estimation of a novel hybrid of 12 peptides of hirudin and reteplase", "keywords": ["Antigenic epitope estimation", "C-terminal 12 residue of hirudin-PA", "Function analysis", "Reteplase", "Three-dimensional structure prediction"], "venue": "Journal of Molecular Modeling", "year": 2015, "abstract": "Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases are leading causes of morbidity and mortality for human beings, and thrombosis is the major risk factor.

Thus, a novel hybrid (HV12p-rPA) comprised of the C-terminal 12 residues of hirudin-PA (HV12p) and reteplase (rPA) was designed. The three-dimensional structure of this hybrid was mimicked based on homology modeling and refined with dynamics simulation by utilizing Amber12.0 software. The function of the hybrid was analyzed by structure comparison and the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of C\u03b1 atoms between the hybrid and native rPA was calculated. The results showed that HV12p, which was located in the N-terminus of the hybrid, was far from the rPA segment of the hybrid and had no influence on the conformational stability of the rPA domain. The RMSD of C\u03b1 atoms of these superimposed proteins was about 40\u00c5, implying that the hybrid had a similar spatial conformation to that of native rPA.

On the day following acquisition of morphine CPP, a single administration of SPD at 10 or 20 mg/kg failed to block the expression of CPP. However, daily administration of SPD at 20 mg/kg for 7 days attenuated the maintenance of CPP. Morphine-induced CPP extinguished after a 21-day saline training and then a single injection of morphine (3 mg/kg, i.p.) induced re-acquisition of morphine CPP; however, pretreatment with SPD at 10 or 20 mg/kg 30 min before morphine injection dose-dependently blocked morphine (3 mg/kg, i.p.)-induced re-acquisition of morphine CPP.

The geologic and geographic conditions of Danxia landform and their differences of the three areas are analyzed. The Danxia geomorphologic landscapes, such as upright-shaped peaks, Danxia mesa, stone wall, cave and vertical cave, Danxia natural bridge, \"a narrow strip of sky\" and so on, are generally formed in the southeast area. The landscape of southwest area is characterized by Danxia escarpment face, waterfall and waterfall groups. The special landscapes in arid areas are found in the northwest area, for example, the mud-coating type, columniation type and board type of Danxia andforms, however there are more differences here than in the other two areas because of the complexity of the nature including the climate, running water, wind abrasion, the loessial cover and relevant elements and so on.

Then, we determined the growing season beginning and end dates by computing times when 50% of the species had undergone leaf unfolding and leaf coloration for each station year. Next, we used these beginning and end dates of the growing season as time markers to determine corresponding threshold NDVI values on NDVI curves for the pixels overlaying phenological stations. Based on a cluster analysis, we determined extrapolation areas for each phenological station in every year, and then implemented the spatial extrapolation of growing season parameters from the seven sample stations to all possible meteorological stations in the study area. Results show that spatial patterns of growing season beginning and end dates correlate significantly with spatial patterns of mean air temperatures in spring and autumn, respectively. Contrasting with results from similar studies in Europe and North America, our study suggests that there is a significant delay in leaf coloration dates, along with a less pronounced advance of leaf unfolding dates in different latitudinal zones and the whole area from 1982 to 1993. The growing season has been extended by 1.4-3.6 days per year in the northern zones and by 1.4 days per year across the entire study area on average. The apparent delay in growing season end dates is associated with regional cooling from late spring to summer, while the insignificant advancement in beginning dates corresponds to inconsistent temperature trend changes from late winter to spring. On an interannual basis, growing season beginning and end dates correlate negatively with mean air temperatures from February to April and from May to June, respectively. \u00a9 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.", "pid": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f7fad9"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Xiaoqiu Chen", "org": "Department of Geography", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fb9411"}, {"name": "Rong Yu", "org": "Department of Geography", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fa2597"}], "title": "Spatial and temporal variations of the vegetation growing season in warm-temperate eastern China during 1982 to 1999", "keywords": ["NDVI", "Phenological cumulative frequency modeling", "Phenological season", "Vegetation growing season", "Warm-temperate eastern China"], "venue": "Acta Geographica Sinica", "year": 2007, "abstract": "Phenological observation data of plant communities from 1982 to 1996 at 5 sites and a method for phenological cumulative frequency modeling were used to determine the beginning dates of local phenological seasons and their corresponding threshold values of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in each year.

During the first 2 wk of life, IGF-I gene deficiency and the resulting reduction in serum IGF-I levels in LID mice did not reach sufficiently low levels when mice experience the most rapid and growth hormone (GH)-independent growth. It suggests that the role of liver-derived IGF-I in prepubertal, GH-independent postnatal growth cannot be established. From our previous studies, liver IGF-I mRNA level was abolished in adult LID mice, which causes elevated GH level, insulin resistance, pancreatic islet enlargement, and hyperinsulinemia. Interestingly in 2-yr-old LID mice, although liver IGF-I mRNA and serum IGF-I levels were still suppressed, serum insulin and GH levels had returned to normal. Compared with same-sex control littermates, aged male LID mice had significantly reduced body weight and fat mass and exhibited normal insulin sensitivity. On the other hand, aged female LID mice exhibited normal weight and marginal resistance to insulin actions. The pancreatic islet percentage (reflecting islet cell mass) was also restored to normal levels in aged LID mice. Thus, although the IGF-I gene deficiency is well maintained into old age, the insulin sensitivity, islet enlargement, and hyperinsulinemia that occurred in young adult mice have been mostly restored to normal levels, further supporting the age-dependent and sexual dimorphic features of the LID mice.

HCV NS5A protein was expressed and purified. Aptamers against NS5A were screened and obtained by the selective evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment approach and the antiviral actions of the aptamers were tested. The mechanisms through which the aptamers exert their antiviral activity were explored. The aptamers NS5A-4 and NS5A-5 inhibit HCV RNA replication and infectious virus production without causing cytotoxicity in human hepatocytes. The aptamers do not affect hepatitis B virus replication in HepG2.2.15 cells. Interferon beta (IFN-\u03b2) and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) are not induced by the aptamers in HCV-infected hepatocytes. Further study shows that domain I and domain III of NS5A protein are involved in the suppression of HCV RNA replication and infectious virus production by NS5A-4. Y2105H within NS5A is the major resistance mutation identified. NS5A aptamer disrupts the interaction of NS5A with core protein. The data suggest that the aptamers against NS5A protein may exert antiviral effects through inhibiting viral RNA replication, preventing the interaction of NS5A with core protein. Aptamers for NS5A may be used to understand the mechanisms of virus replication and assembly and served as potential therapeutic agents for hepatitis C. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to compare and evaluate these methods, taking Three-North shelter forest as a study case, the commonly used methods were implemented to identify the characteristic scale. The results showed that the wavelet had a reasonable and clear process, and its outcome measures were time saving. The semivariance was much flexible and its results were clear but consuming time. The outcome of scale variance and lacunarity for characteristic scale detecting were almost indiscernible. We concluded that the most optimal way of scale analysis lied in the combination of semivariance and wavelet.

AtCBF4 (C-repeat binding factor 4) is a homolog of the CBF/DREB1 (dehydration-responsive element-binding protein 1) transcription factors that plays important roles during drought tolerance. Here, we report the functional characterization of transgenic maize (inbred line Mo17) expressing AtCBF4 under the control of RD29A (responsive to dehydration 29A) promoter from Arabidopsis. Some morphological and physiological traits related to drought tolerance such as relative water content (RWC), proline and MDA (malondialdehyde) content, etc. were measured. The results show that expression of AtCBF4 in maize significantly enhanced drought tolerance. Under dehydration stress, AtCBF4 transgenic plants L3, L4 and L8 showed lower cell membrane damage (decreased 21-24%), higher relative water content (increased 7-12%), higher total soluble sugars (increased 7-29%), higher proline content (increased 23-37%), better growth and development, greater biomass and higher grain yield (increased 20-25%), compared to wild type. Furthermore, the transgenic lines kept significantly higher germination index and drought tolerance index under PEG condition.

Plant organ boundaries separate lateral organs from the apical meristem and harbor axillary meristems (AMs). AMs, as stem cell niches, make the shoot a ramifying system. Although AMs have important functions in plant development, our knowledge of organ boundary and AM formation remains rudimentary. Here, we generated a cellular-resolution genomewide gene expression map for low-abundance Arabidopsis thaliana organ boundary cells and constructed a genomewide protein-DNA interaction map focusing on genes affecting boundary and AM formation. The resulting GRN uncovers transcriptional signatures, predicts cellular functions, and identifies promoter hub regions that are bound by many TFs. Importantly, further experimental studies determined the regulatory effects of many TFs on their targets, identifying regulators and regulatory relationships in AM initiation.

SARP was defined as greater than or equal 3 side effects and graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0.The clinical and dosimetric factors were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the relationship between clinical, dosimetric factors and SARP.Results: Median follow-up was 10.5 months (range 6.5-24). Of 94 patients, 11 (11.7%) developed SARP. Univariate analyses showed that the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP), mean lung dose (MLD), relative volumes of lung receiving more than a threshold dose of 5-60 Gy at increments of 5 Gy (V5-V60), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and Forced Expiratory Volume in the first second (FEV1) were associated with SARP (p < 0.05). In multivariate analysis, NTCP value (p = 0.001) and V10 (p = 0.015) were the most significant factors associated with SARP. The incidences of SARP in the group with NTCP > 4.2% and NTCP \u22644.2% were 43.5% and 1.4%, respectively (p < 0.01). The incidences of SARP in the group with V10 \u226450% and V10 >50% were 5.7% and 29.2%, respectively (p < 0.01).Conclusions: NTCP value and V10 are the useful indicators for predicting SARP in NSCLC patients treated with concurrent chemotherapy and IMRT. \u00a9 2010 Shi et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "pid": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e15169050"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Rong Yu", "org": "Key laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education)", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151dd4b9"}, {"name": "Yongheng Li", "org": "Key laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education)", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fbe0f2"}, {"name": "Guangying Zhu", "org": "Key laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education)", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e151839b6"}], "title": "Stereotactic Body Radiaton Therapy for 15 Patients with Small Lung Neoplasms", "keywords": ["Lung neoplasms", "Radiotherapy", "Treatment outcome"], "venue": "Chinese Journal of Lung Cancer", "year": 2011, "abstract": "Background and objective It has been known that stereotactic radiotherapy has been widely used in clinical practice.

Methods: Twenty patients with EC were selected, including 5 cases located in the cervical, the upper, the middle and the lower thorax, respectively. Five plans were generated with the eclipse planning system: three using c-IMRT with 5 fields (5F), 7 fields (7F) and 9 fields (9F), and two using VMAT with a single arc (1A) and double arcs (2A). The treatment plans were designed to deliver a dose of 60 Gy to the planning target volume (PTV) with the same constrains in a 2.0 Gy daily fraction, 5 d a week. Plans were normalized to 95% of the PTV that received 100% of the prescribed dose. We examined the dose-volume histogram parameters of PTV and the organs at risk (OAR) such as lungs, spinal cord and heart. Monitor units (MU) and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) of OAR were also reported. Results: Both c-IMRT and VMAT plans resulted in abundant dose coverage of PTV for EC of different locations. The dose conformity to PTV was improved as the number of field in c-IMRT or rotating arc in VMAT was increased. The doses to PTV and OAR in VMAT plans were not statistically different in comparison with c-IMRT plans, with the following exceptions: in cervical and upper thoracic EC, the conformity index (CI) was higher in VMAT (1A 0.78 and 2A 0.8) than in c-IMRT (5F 0.62, 7F 0.66 and 9F 0.73) and homogeneity was slightly better in c-IMRT (7F 1.09 and 9F 1.07) than in VMAT (1A 1.1 and 2A 1.09). Lung V30 was lower in VMAT (1A 12.52 and 2A 12.29) than in c-IMRT (7F 14.35 and 9F 14.81). The humeral head doses were significantly increased in VMAT as against c-IMRT. In the middle and lower thoracic EC, CI in VMAT (1A 0.76 and 2A 0.74) was higher than in c-IMRT (5F 0.63 Gy and 7F 0.67 Gy), and homogeneity was almost similar between VMAT and c-IMRT. V20 (2A 21.49 Gy vs 7F 24.59 Gy and 9F 24.16 Gy) and V30 (2A 9.73 Gy vs 5F 12.61 Gy, 7F 11.5 Gy and 9F 11.37 Gy) of lungs in VMAT were lower than in c-IMRT, but low doses to lungs (V5 and V10) were increased. V30 (1A 48.12 Gy vs 5F 59.2 Gy, 7F 58.59 Gy and 9F 57.2 Gy), V40 and V50 of heart in VMAT was lower than in c-IMRT. MUs in VMAT plans were significantly reduced in comparison with c-IMRT, maximum doses to the spinal cord and mean doses of lungs were similar between the two techniques. NTCP of spinal cord was 0 for all cases. NTCP of lungs and heart in VMAT were lower than in c-IMRT. The advantage of VMAT plan was enhanced by doubling the arc. Conclusion: Compared with c-IMRT, VMAT, especially the 2A, slightly improves the OAR dose sparing, such as lungs and heart, and reduces NTCP and MU with a better PTV coverage. \u00a9 2012 Baishideng.

In a cohort of medically operable non-small cell lung cancer patients receiving stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) survival rates \"potentially equivalent to those of surgery\" have been reported. Removing the field flattening filter, Clinac is capable of delivering dose rates much higher than conventional linac as well as reducing the treatment time. The goals of this work were to report safety and efficacy of SBRT treatment using a flattening filter-free model for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with small lesions. Methods From December 2011 to December 2013, 31 NSCLC patients who were T1-2N0M0, solitary pulmonary recurrence after surgery, and stage IV with oligo metastasis were enrolled, receiving SBRT treatment (60 Gy/8 f or 48 Gy/4 f) applying a flattening filter-free model. Results Compared with conventional technique, flattening filter-free model shortened the treating time with equivalent target dose and normal tissue dose. The median follow-up time is 19.4 mo. The 1-yr local control, regional control, distant control, progression free survival and overall survival rates were 96.8%, 96.8%, 83.9%, 77.4% and 96.8%. The most common side effects were radiation pneumonitis (29% grade 1, 3.2% grade 2) and chest pain (12.9% grade 1,6.5% grade 2). Conclusion The use of flattening filter-free model in SBRT for small lesions of NSCLC patients is safe and effective. Long time follow-up and additional studies are still needed to validate our conclusions.", "pid": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1518411c"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Guang Chen", "org": "Department of Cementing Technology", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fd1388"}, {"name": "Chun-Ying Shao", "org": "Department of Cementing Technology", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150b33ed"}, {"name": "Rong Yu", "org": "Department of Cementing Technology", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15023af1"}, {"name": "Yan-Xia Ding", "org": "Department of Cementing Technology", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fcf12a"}, {"name": "Zheng-Hui Tang", "org": "Department of Cementing Technology", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1512c26a"}], "title": "Cementing technology for low-pressure lost circulation zones in Block Su-25 in Changqing", "keywords": ["Block Su-25", "Cement slurry", "Gas well cementing", "Losses", "Low-pressure"], "venue": "Drilling Fluid and Completion Fluid", "year": 2007, "abstract": "The Block Su-25 in Changqing Oilfield has heaving formations into which mud losses frequently take place and from which water production is high.

After three subcutaneous vaccinations, in trial one, in the absence of adjuvant, primary juvenile worm cells (pJCs) from S. japonicum induced remarkable average reductions in worm burden (54.3%), liver eggs per gram (LEPG) load (59.8%) as well as egg granulomas size (66.5%) compared to PBS control group (P<0.01), which were significantly higher than those elicited by fractions of juvenile worm cells (JCFs) or fractions of juvenile worms (JWFs) (P<0.05). Non-cell components of worms (WNCs) showed no significant protection. In trial two, compared to PBS control group, significant protective effect was also observed for cultured juvenile worm cells (cJCs) from S. japonicum with 58.4% worm reduction and 68.1% LEPG reduction (P<0.01). However, cultured adult worms cells (cACs) showed significantly higher worm burden (P<0.05) and egg burden (P<0.01) when compared to cJCs. Immunological analysis of trial two revealed that cJCs engendered a Th1-biased mixed Th1/Th2 type of immune response while cACs elicited a Th2-type response. Our data indicated that immunization with both primary and cultured cells from S. japonicum juvenile worms provided high immunoprotection, for which the physical character of immunogens, stage-specific parasite and the type of immune response induced might be responsible, suggesting that vaccination with whole cells from S. japonicum larvae is a promising approach to produce protective immunity against schistosomiasis. \u00a9 2007 Science in China Press.", "pid": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150c1349"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Xiao-Hong Li", "org": "Lanzhou Institute of Physics", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1514f694"}, {"name": "Wan-Tu Guo", "org": "Lanzhou Institute of Physics", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f4f2a3"}, {"name": "Xue-Kang Chen", "org": "Lanzhou Institute of Physics", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e151325be"}, {"name": "Gan Wu", "org": "Lanzhou Institute of Physics", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1503247a"}, {"name": "Jian-Ping Yang", "org": "Lanzhou Institute of Physics", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1502f376"}, {"name": "Rui Wang", "org": "Lanzhou Institute of Physics", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150c8078"}, {"name": "Sheng-Zhu Cao", "org": "Lanzhou Institute of Physics", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151ede6e"}, {"name": "Rong Yu", "org": "Lanzhou Institute of Physics", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150e9412"}], "title": "The effect of pressure on growth rate and quality of diamond films prepared by microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition", "keywords": ["Deposition pressure", "Diamond films", "Growth rate"], "venue": "Wuli Xuebao/Acta Physica Sinica", "year": 2007, "abstract": "The effect of total pressure on growth rate and quality of diamond films prepared by microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition was investigated.

Yes, The author has found out the relationship among the external temperature, the measured temperature and the thermoelectric potential generated through the thermocouple transducer by comparing a great deal of thermocouple transducers, that is, there is a certain linear relationship existing in a high-order power series function. So we have used high-speed operational amplifiers to compute the high-order power series function and compensate the circuit in order to realize the real-time compensation for thermocouple transducers, which has not only realized the linearity optimization of them, but also got the instantaneous time of temperature measurement. In the end the accuracy of the controlled temperature has greatly increased.

The aim of this study was to investigate a novel technique of perichondrium/cartilage composite graft for repairing the large TM perforation in the patient of otitis media. Methods: Retrospective chart reviews were conducted for 102 patients with large tympanic membrane perforations, who had undergone tympanoplasty from August 2005 to August 2008. Tympanoplasty or tympanomastoidectomy using a perichondrium/ cartilage composite graft was analyzed. The tragal or conchal perichondrium/cartilage was used to replace the tympanic membrane in patients. Results: Patients aged from 13 to 67 years were followed up in average for 24 months (10-36 months). Seventy-four ears (72.61%) were used the tragal perichondrium/cartilage as graft material and 27 ears (27.39%) were used the conchal perichondrium/cartilage. Graft take was successful in all patients. Postoperative complications such as wound infection, hematoma, or sensorineural hearing loss were not identified. Nine patients (8.82%) had the partial ossicular replacement prosthesis, 14 patients (13.72%) using the autologous curved incus and 79 patients (77.45%) without prosthesis. Successful closure occurred in 92% of the ears. A total of 85.8% patients achieved a postoperative hearing improvement.

Background. Somatostatin prevents cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis. Downregulation of the XAF1 transcript may occur during the development of prostate cancer. It is interesting to evaluate the potential regulatory effects of somatostatin on XAF1 expression during the development of prostate cancer cells. Methods. XAF1 mRNA and protein expression in human prostate epithelial cells RWPE-1, androgen dependent prostate cancer LNCaP, and androgen independent DU145 and PC3 cells were evaluated using RT-PCR and Western blot. The regulation of XAF1 mRNA and protein expression by somatostatin and its analogue Octreotide was evaluated. Results. Substantial levels of XAF1 mRNA and proteins were detected in RWPE-1 cells, whereas prostate cancer cells LNCaP, DU145 and PC3 exhibited lower XAF1 expression. Somatostatin and Octreotide up-regulated XAF1 mRNA and protein expression in all prostate cancer cell lines. Conclusions. XAF1 down-regulation may contribute to the prostate cancer development. The enhanced XAF1 expression by somatostatin indicates a promising strategy for prostate cancer therapy. \u00a9 2010 Xing et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "pid": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1509b872"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Rong Yu", "org": "College of Media Sciences", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150e78cf"}], "title": "Implementing ideological and political education in university classroom teaching", "keywords": ["Classroom teaching", "Ideological and political education", "Undergraduate education"], "venue": "Proceedings - 2010 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Education, ICAIE 2010", "year": 2010, "abstract": "University classroom as a teaching principal position, whose ideological and political education role and function often has been neglected.

After I/R injury, cardiac function was evaluated by echocardiography and biologic markers at day 1, day 3, day 7, day 14, day 21 and day 28. At day 1 after I/R injury, in comparison to the NS group, morphine preconditioning: (i) significantly improved haemo dynamic parameters; (ii) reduced myocardial infarct size; (iii) lowered troponin I level. At day 28 after I/R injury, the concentration of B-type natriuretic peptide was significantly lower in the MPC group compared to the NS group.

We investigated the effect of three different implant surface topologies on osteoblast response and bone regeneration. In this study, implants with nanotubes and micropores were used, and implants with flat surfaces were used as the control group. Results: Our in vitro studies showed that the nanostructured topologies improved the proliferation, differentiation, and development of the osteoblastic phenotype. Histological analysis further revealed that the nanotopology increased cell aggregation at the implant-tissue interfaces and enhanced bone-forming ability. Pushout testing indicated that the nanostructured topology greatly increased the bone-implant interfacial strength within 4 weeks of implantation. Conclusion: Nanotopography may improve regeneration of bone tissue and shows promise for dental implant applications. \u00a9 2012 Xia et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.", "pid": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1504be7a"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Rong Yu", "org": "College of Information, Mechanical and Engineering", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f7b9f0"}, {"name": "Gengming Zhao", "org": "College of Information, Mechanical and Engineering", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e1509ff03"}], "title": "Algorithm research on GPS-based bus-stop auto-announcement system", "keywords": ["Bus-stop auto-announcement", "Cohen-Sutherland line clipping algorithm", "Region code"], "venue": "2011 2nd International Conference on Mechanic Automation and Control Engineering, MACE 2011 - Proceedings", "year": 2011, "abstract": "Aiming at improving the accuracy of bus-stop auto-announcement system, based on the Cohen-Sutherland line clipping algorithm, an improved algorithm is proposed.

Increasing evidence shows that the microvasculature plays a critical role in progressive renal disease. The present study was undertaken to investigate whether interstitial fibrosis could be prevented by abolishing TSP-1 function in unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO)-induced renal fibrosis. Methods and Results: A short hairpin RNA vector, designated Thbs-1, significantly suppressed TSP-1 in both transcriptional and translational levels in in vitro-cultured cells and in vivo fibrosis-induced mouse kidney. Furthermore, TSP-1 RNA interference increased the protein level of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the density of peritubular capillaries (PTCs), reduced the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 in tubulointerstitial cells, and collagen III and the connective tissue growth factor expression were markedly reduced from day 7 after UUO-induced fibrosis, but un- or vector-treated mice maintained their expression. TSP-1 shRNA suppressed the protein level of TSP-1, increased VEGF expression and PTC density and alleviated the development of renal interstitial fibrosis in UUO mice. Conclusion: These data suggest that inhibition of TSP-1 expression prevented tubulointerstitial fibrosis through ameliorating PTC injury. Copyright \u00a9 2011 S.

Technical Illustration is the most important part of IETM. One difficulty urgent need to solve is how to extract the complex production process of technical illustration effectively. To deal with this difficulty, a detailed study of technical illustration rules was conducted based on engineering experience and the Hollink framework for the classification of image descriptions by users. First, this paper introduced some basic contents and concepts about IETM and its technical illustration, and then analyzed the Hollink framework which was aimed to resolve the mismatch between user needs and image retrieval techniques. Second, this paper gave the general requirements and principles of technical illustration rules, which were based on large practical experiences in project implementation and the understanding of the Hollink framework. Third, this paper gave the specific requirements and detailed content of technical illustration rules, such as the conversion between 2D graphics and 3D graphics, the preprocessing of 2D graphics, the callout of illustration, the distribution layer of illustration and the layout of illustration. Finally, this paper described the concrete effect when the technical illustration rules were used to complete actual projects.

Methods: Twenty-one patients with 22 focuses of breast mucinous carcinoma confirmed pathologically were enrolled. The correlation between the ultrasonic and mammogram findings and histological features were analyzed retrospectively. Results: These 22 focuses of breast mucinous carcinoma included pure type (n=14) and mixed type (n=8), the former included 6 cellular type and 8 hypocellular type. On US examination, all patients had solid mass. The pure type masses showed well-defined margins without pseudocapsule and isoechogenic or hypoechoic internal echo pattern relative to that of subcutaneous fat in 85.71% (12/14) focuses, 92.86% (13/14) pure type focuses had posterior enhancement, while 75.00% (6/8) of mixed type lumps and 14.29% (2/14) of pure type lumps demonstrated as ill-defined and/or spiculated margins with hypoechogenic structure. There were 63.64% (14/22) of lesions classified as BI-RADS 4 or 5 suspected as malignancy by ultrasonography and mammograms, respectively. These mammograms features contained 10 masses, 2 focal asymmetries, 1 architectural distortion with malignant calcification and 1 isolated indifferent calcification. The main mammographic appearances of masses were well-defined margins with microlobulation for pure type, poorly differentiated or speculated margins for mixed type. There was 81.82% (18/22) of focuses suspected as malignancy by mammography or ultrasonography. There was 45.45% (10/22) of focuses suspected as malignancy by both mammogram and ultrasonography. Conclusion: Mucinous breast carcinomas, especially pure type ones do not have typical image features, which might be diagnosed as benign focuses by mammography and/or ultrasound. Margins of the masses are very important for differential diagnosis. Mixed type mucinous carcinomas have more aggressive imaging characteristics, which demonstrate ill-defined and/or speculated margins. Combination of mammogram with ultrasonography is helpful to avoiding miss. Biopsy should be performed when malignancy is suspected by mammogram or ultrasonography.

The correlation between the cyst size, gestational age, and prenatal and neonatal outcome was analyzed. Results: The overall incidence of fetal dacryocystocele was 0.016% (75/456,202). Fifty-three cases (70.7%) had unilateral, and 22 (29.3%) had bilateral lesions. Lesions were seen more commonly among female fetuses with a female:male ratio 1.48:1. The average diameter of cysts size was 6.9\u00b11.9mm (3.3-11mm). There was a direct correlation between cyst size and gestational age. Among the 75 cases, 8 were lost to follow-up, 3 underwent elective termination of pregnancy. 58 resolved spontaneously before birth, and 6 were confirmed at birth. Two developed neonatal infection requiring antibiotic treatment. All 6 cases confirmed at birth resolved without surgical resection. Conclusions: Congenital dacryocystocele can be diagnosed by prenatal ultrasound. Such lesions typically resolve spontaneously in utero or in the early neonatal period.

It has great potential for developing high resistant starch (RS) products. Until recently, most of the studies on the RS preparation have focused on high-amylose corn starch or root vegetables starch. In addition, there is a greater difference between rice starch and other kinds of starch in particle characteristics, composition, etc. The production processes of RS cannot simply be deduced from previous reports. In order to make use of Yitang rice rationally, this article focuses on the production processes of RS as a functional food ingredient. The production processes of Yitang Rice RS were optimized through a Box-Benhnken center-united experiment design and Response Surface Methodology (RSM), based on single-factor experiments of moisture content (starch concentration), pH value, autoclaving treatment temperature, cooling method, cold storage time, drying temperature, and the number of autoclaving treatments. RS characteristics analysis was discussed by assistant analyses of absorption curves of starch and I2-KI compound, infrared spectroscopy, average polymerization degree, scanning electron microscopy, solubility, and water-holding capacity. The results showed that the most influential process factors were moisture content (starch concentration), pH, autoclaving treatment time, and cold storage time. The optimum conditions were a starch concentration of 31%, pH value 5.8, heating time 50 min (under 0.1 MPa, 120\u00b0C), natural cooling and cold storage time 15 h, drying temperature 80\u00b0C, three autoclaving treatment times, together yielding an RS fraction of 20.1%. The characteristics analysis showed that the \"Yitang Rice\" RS has ordered crystalline structure which was formed by recrystallizing during starch retrogradation, and the major component of it is short amylose (polymerization degree is 21.43). The characteristics of RS crystal structure which has a narrow molecular-weight distribution and more hydro-keys than native starch are compact and solid. Therefore, its solubility decreased 85.9% as compared to native Yitang rice. However, the RS surface exhibits a multi-pore structure that makes its water-holding capacity higher than other common RS and dietary fiber products such as potatoes RS and corn RS. This research can provide a method for improving the yield of RS from \"Yitang Rice\" and an explanation of the mechanisms of RS formation, which can promote the wide development and utilization of \"Yitang Rice\" resources.", "pid": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150d3cd5"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Rong Yu", "org": "College of Information and Engineering Nanchang University", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1506e0df"}, {"name": "Yuhao Wang", "org": "College of Information and Engineering Nanchang University", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150b19cd"}, {"name": "Yanqing Wang", "org": "College of Information and Engineering Nanchang University", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15035b39"}, {"name": "Xiaolei Wang", "org": "College of Information and Engineering Wuhan University", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e15181813"}, {"name": "Junle Zhou", "org": "College of Information and Engineering Nanchang University", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e15176b4a"}], "title": "Design of electromagnetic sensor used for the real-time detections of nitrate concentrations in water", "keywords": ["Electromagnetic field", "Interdigital capacitor", "Nitrate", "Planar electromagnetic", "Sensor"], "venue": "Chinese Journal of Sensors and Actuators", "year": 2013, "abstract": "In recent years, the underlying problems of water contaminations have emerged, and inorganic pollutants, especially nitrate or nitrite have posed a threat to people's health.

This study employs an ecological input-output model to reveal the impact of domestic consumption and international trade on cultivated land distributions in China during 1987-2007. According to the high-sectoral-resolution dataset, Agriculture and Food Processing are identified as the two key sectors which contribute the largest volumes of embodied cultivated land to meet household food demand in 2007. The indicators of production- and consumption-based cultivated land are highly correlated during the research period: both experience a phase of stability during 1987-1995, then a boom from 1995 to 1997, and a steady decrease afterward. Although the total cultivated land use in China is fluctuating, the embodied intensity shows a declining trend from 7.12 ha/thousand Yuan in 1987 to 0.43 ha/thousand Yuan in 2007, with an annual decrease rate of 13.09%. With respect to trade pattern, the Agriculture sector is China's largest net importer of cultivated land, in contrast to the Textile sector as the largest net exporter.

Beyond the battery constraint of sensors/aggregation and forwarding nodes (AFNs), the major energy consumption of WSNs is from the longdistance multi-hop transmissions from the sensors/AFNs to the sink. To address these issues, in this paper, we employ a wireless charging vehicle (WCV) to travel inside WSNs to replenish the energy of sensors/AFNs, and cut long-distance transmissions into short-distance ones. Different from prior works, we let the WCV not only recharge the AFNs selectively, but also collect data from chosen AFNs and bring collected data back to the sink. The chosen AFNs play as virtual sinks, and nearby AFNs can use short-distance transmissions to deliver their traffic to the chosen AFNs. We formulate this problem into an energy replenishment optimization with joint consideration of sensed data delivery, flow routing, wireless power transfer, etc. Since the formulated problem is mixed integer nonlinear programming which is NP-hard to solve, we also develop a heuristic algorithm for feasible solutions.

We found a suspect clinical CNDI pedigree. In order to identify the genetic etiology, we performed the genetic analysis. Methods The clinical features of the proband and his family members were recorded. The laboratory tests and imaging inspections were analyzed. The water deprivation and pituitrin loading test were performed in the proband and his brother. The genomic DNA of all the members of the pedigree was extracted and then PCR amplification on AVPR2 gene was carried out. Sequencing in both directions was performed to identify mutation on AVPR2 gene. Results Both the proband and his brother were diagnosed as CNDI, meanwhile the other members of this pedigree were normal. No severe biochemical abnormality was found in the two CNDI patients. Both the patients had moderate urinary retention, severe megaloureter and hydronephrosis, and mild renal insufficiency. Two mutations of AVPR2 gene were discovered in the 3rd exon in the patients, a silent mutation L309L and a nonsense mutation R337X. The AVPR2 gene R337X mutation was co-segregated with CNDI. R337X mutation was not a reported mutation in the mainland of China.

A particular focus is on Kondo destruction, which leads to quantum criticality that goes beyond the Landau framework of order-parameter fluctuations. This unconventional quantum criticality has provided an understanding of the unusual dynamical scaling observed experimentally. It also predicted a sudden jump of the Fermi surface and an extra (Kondo destruction) energy scale, both of which have been verified by systematic experiments. Considerations of Kondo destruction have in addition yielded a global phase diagram, which has motivated the current interest in heavy fermion materials with variable dimensionality or geometrical frustration. Here we summarize these developments, and discuss some of the ongoing work and open issues. We also consider the implications of these results for superconductivity. Finally, we address the effect of spin-orbit coupling on the global phase diagram, suggest that SmB6 under pressure may display unconventional superconductivity in the transition regime between a Kondo insulator phase and an antiferroamgnetic metal phase, and argue that the interfaces of heavy-fermion heterostructures will provide a fertile setting to explore topological properties of both Kondo insulators and heavyfermion superconductors.", "pid": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e150988f7"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Rong Yu", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Biocontrol, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1514e1a1"}, {"name": "Xinping Xu", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Biocontrol, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fefae9"}, {"name": "Yongkang Liang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Biocontrol, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fcbb18"}, {"name": "Honggang Tian", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Biocontrol, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e15134342"}, {"name": "Zhanqing Pan", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Biocontrol, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fc658f"}, {"name": "Shouheng Jin", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Biocontrol, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fa9b4f"}, {"name": "Na Wang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Biocontrol, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151a9eeb"}, {"name": "Wenqing Zhang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Biocontrol, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150cc67c"}], "title": "The insect ecdysone receptor is a good potential target for RNAi-based pest control", "keywords": ["Ecdysone receptor (EcR)", "Nilaparvata lugens", "Pest control", "RNA interference", "Transgenic rice"], "venue": "International Journal of Biological Sciences", "year": 2014, "abstract": "RNA interference (RNAi) has great potential for use in insect pest control. However, some significant challenges must be overcome before RNAi-based pest control can become a reality. One challenge is the proper selection of a good target gene for RNAi. Here, we report that the insect ecdysone receptor (EcR) is a good potential target for RNAi-based pest control in the brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens, a serious insect pest of rice plants. We demonstrated that the use of a 360 bp fragment (NlEcR-c) that is common between NlEcR-A and NlEcR-B for feeding RNAi experiments significantly decreased the relative mRNA expression levels of NlEcR compared with those in the dsGFP control. Feeding RNAi also resulted in a significant reduction in the number of offspring per pair of N. lugens. Consequently, a transgenic rice line expressing NlEcR dsRNA was constructed by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The results of qRT-PCR showed that the total copy number of the target gene in all transgenic rice lines was 2. Northern blot analysis showed that the small RNA of the hairpin dsNlEcR-c was successfully expressed in the transgenic rice lines. After newly hatched nymphs of N. lugens fed on the transgenic rice lines, effective RNAi was observed. The NlEcR expression levels in all lines examined were decreased significantly compared with the control. In all lines, the survival rate of the nymphs was nearly 90%, and the average number of offspring per pair in the treated groups was significantly less than that observed in the control, with a decrease of 44.18-66.27%.

This study investigated whether and how fructose caused hypothalamic astrogliosis and inflammation in vivo and in vitro. The inhibitory effects of betaine on hypothalamic neural injury, astrogliosis, and inflammation were explored to address its improvement of fructose-induced metabolic syndrome. Methods and results: Rats or astrocytes were exposed to fructose and then treated with betaine. Neural injury, proinflammatory markers, Toll-like receptor 4/nuclear factor-\u03baB (TLR4/NF-\u03baB) pathway, and histone deacetylases 3 (HDAC3) expressions were evaluated. The reduction of pro-opiomelanocortin and melanocortin 4 receptor positive neurons in fructose-fed rats was ameliorated by betaine. Moreover, fructose induced astrogliosis and proinflammatory cytokine production by increasing TLR4, MyD88 (where MyD88 is myeloid differentiation factor 88), and NF-\u03baB expression in rat hypothalamus and astrocytes. HDAC3 overexpression preserved the prolonged inflammation in fructose-stimulated astrocytes by regulating nuclear NF-\u03baB-dependent transcription. Betaine suppressed TLR4/NF-\u03baB pathway activation and HDAC3 expression, contributing to its inhibition of hypothalamic astrogliosis and inflammation in animal and cell models. Conclusion: These findings suggest that betaine inhibits fructose-caused astrogliosis and inflammation by the suppression of TLR4/NF-\u03baB pathway activation and HDAC3 expression to protect against hypothalamic neural injury, which, at least partly, contributes to the improvement of fructose-induced metabolic syndrome.", "pid": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1512f227"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Chunhua Peng", "org": "School of Electrical & Electronics Engineering, East China Jiaotong University", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fc8b72"}, {"name": "Rong Yu", "org": "School of Electrical & Electronics Engineering, East China Jiaotong University", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1503543e"}, {"name": "Huijuan Sun", "org": "School of Electrical & Electronics Engineering, East China Jiaotong University", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150e9156"}], "title": "Multi-objective DG planning based on K-means clustering and multi-scenario timing characteristics analysis", "keywords": ["Distributed power generation", "K-means clustering", "Multi-objective decision-making", "Multi-scenario probability", "Planning", "Timing characteristics"], "venue": "Dianli Zidonghua Shebei/Electric Power Automation Equipment", "year": 2015, "abstract": "If the volatility of DG(Distributed Generation) outputs and the uncertainty of load demands are not considered, the planned DG capacity may become larger or the voltage profile improvement rate lower.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of stem cell-related factors in rat ovarian granulosa cells. METHODS: After the paraffin sections of rat ovarian tissue, immunohistochemical method was used to detect CD34, CD133, ABCG2/Bcrp1, Pou5f1/Oct-4 expressions. Granulosa cells cultured in vitro were harvested by follicular puncture method, and then the immunohistochemical method was used to detect the expression of FSHR receptor in order to identify the purity of granule cells. In the cultured granulosa cells, CD44 and C-Kit expressions were detected immunohistochemically, RT-PCR was used to detect ABCG2/Bcrp1, Pou5f1/Oct-4, Nanog gene expressions in ovarian tissue and granulosa cells. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Immunohistochemistry detection on paraffin sections showed that a part of ovarian granulosa cells expressed CD34, CD133, ABCG2/Bcrp1 and Pou5f1/Oct-4, and the expression of Pou5f1/Oct-4 protein gradually increased in the development of ovarian follicles, significantly enhanced during the luteal phase, and then disappeared after the formation of corpus albicans, displaying a periodic expression characteristics. FSHR receptor positive identification rate of primary cells harvested by the folliclar puncture method was more than 95%. Granulosa cells cultured in vitro were mainly long spindle-shaped or diamond, and some cells presented with aggregation growth and expressed CD44 and C-Kit. RT-PCR test results showed that there were no Nanog in the ovarian tissue and cultured granulosa cells, low expression of Pou5f1/Oct-4 in the ovarian tissue, strong expression of ABCG2/Bcrp1 in the ovarian tissue, weak expression of Pou5f1/Oct-4 in the cultured granulosa cells, and strong expression of ABCG2/Bcrp1 in the cultured granulosa cells.

The Brillouin zone folding amounts to working with an effective 1-Fe unit cell, instead of the crystallographic 2-Fe unit cell. We show that the folding procedure can be justified by the validity of a glide reflection symmetry throughout the crystallographic Brillouin zone and by the existence of a minimal double degeneracy along the edges of the latter. We also demonstrate how the folding procedure fails when a local spin-orbit coupling is included although the latter does not break any of the space-group symmetries of the bare Hamiltonian. In light of these general symmetry considerations, we further discuss the implications of the glide reflection symmetry for the superconducting pairing in an effective multiorbital t-J1-J2 model.

Different strains of rats were injected at the base of the tail with bovine type II collagen (CII) emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA). The onset and severity of arthritis were evaluated by clinical assessment. The established CIA model was analyzed using a comprehensive examination of clinical, hematological, histological and radiological parameters. The results demonstrated that Wistar rats were the most susceptible strain to CIA followed by Wistar Furth rats, with Sprague Dawley rats being the least susceptible. Following primary and booster immunization, female Wistar rats developed severe arthritis, with an incidence of >83% and low variability in clinical signs. The development of arthritis was accompanied by a significantly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate compared with that in the control rats. The radiographic examination revealed bone matrix resorption, considerable soft tissue swelling, periosteal new bone formation and bone erosion in the arthritic joints of the CIA rats. Histopathologically, the synovial joints of CIA rats were characterized by synovial hyperplasia, pannus formation, marked cellular infiltration, bone and cartilage erosion and narrowing of the joint space. The administration of an intradermal injection of only 200 \u03bcg bovine CII emulsified in IFA at the base of the tail therefore leads to the successful development of a CIA rat model.

Despite TIFY proteins have been reported in Arabidopsis and rice, a comprehensive and systematic survey of ZmTIFY genes has not yet been conducted. To investigate the functions of ZmTIFY genes in this family, we isolated and characterized 30 ZmTIFY (1 TIFY, 3 ZML, and 26 JAZ) genes in an analysis of the maize (Zea mays L.) genome in this study. The 30 ZmTIFY genes were distributed over eight chromosomes. Multiple alignment and motif display results indicated that all ZmTIFY proteins share two conserved TIFY and Jas domains. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the ZmTIFY family could be divided into two groups. Putative cis-elements, involved in abiotic stress response, phytohormones, pollen grain, and seed development, were detected in the promoters of maize TIFY genes. Microarray data showed that the ZmTIFY genes had tissue-specific expression patterns in various maize developmental stages and in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. The results indicated that ZmTIFY4, 5, 8, 26, and 28 were induced, while ZmTIFY16, 13, 24, 27, 18, and 30 were suppressed, by drought stress in the maize inbred lines Han21 and Ye478. ZmTIFY1, 19, and 28 were upregulated after infection by three pathogens, whereas ZmTIFY4, 13, 21, 23, 24, and 26 were suppressed. These results indicate that the ZmTIFY family may have vital roles in response to abiotic and biotic stresses. The data presented in this work provide vital clues for further investigating the functions of the genes in the ZmTIFY family.", "pid": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1505fdc9"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Wei Jia", "org": "Department of Chemistry, Collaborative Innovation Center for Nanomaterial Science, Engineering Tsinghua University", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fd5627"}, {"name": "Yuxi Liu", "org": "Department of Chemistry, Collaborative Innovation Center for Nanomaterial Science, Engineering Tsinghua University", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151a6ce2"}, {"name": "Pengfei Hu", "org": "Laboratory for Microstructures, Shanghai University", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150e909e"}, {"name": "Rong Yu", "org": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Tsinghua University", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e150636b0"}, {"name": "Yu Wang", "org": "Department of Chemistry, Collaborative Innovation Center for Nanomaterial Science, Engineering Tsinghua University", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f8cffc"}, {"name": "Lei Ma", "org": "Department of Chemistry, Collaborative Innovation Center for Nanomaterial Science, Engineering Tsinghua University", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e15092e8c"}, {"name": "Dingsheng Wang", "org": "Department of Chemistry, Collaborative Innovation Center for Nanomaterial Science, Engineering Tsinghua University", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151adb99"}, {"name": "Yadong Li", "org": "Department of Chemistry, Collaborative Innovation Center for Nanomaterial Science, Engineering Tsinghua University", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e15091b3d"}], "title": "Ultrathin CuO nanorods: Controllable synthesis and superior catalytic properties in styrene epoxidation", "venue": "Chemical Communications", "year": 2015, "abstract": "Ultrathin copper oxide (CuO) nanorods with diameters of \u223c3.6 nm were obtained in one step using oleylamine (OAm) as both the solvent and the surface controller.

Whether there are other degradation pathways for IKZF1 in myeloma cells remains unknown. Here, we found that although IKZF1 ubiquitination was reduced, its stability was also significantly reduced in MM1.S and OPM2 cells treated with kinase inhibitors, 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole riboside (DRB) or roscovitine. Through pharmacological inhibition and biochemical approaches we demonstrated that instead of undergoing the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, IKZF1 was degraded through apoptosis induced by kinase inhibition.
