The aim of this study was to investigate whether epithelial-differentiated rabbit adipose-derived stem cells (Epith-rASCs) could play a role of epithelium in vivo functionally and be a potential substitute of urothelium. Substitution urethroplasty was performed to repair an anterior urethral defect in male New Zealand rabbits using Epith-rASCs seeded bladder acellular matrix grafts (BAMGs) after 5-bromo-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling, based on the in vitro epithelial induction system we previously described. Urethroplasty with cell-free BAMGs and with undifferentiated rASCs (Und-rASCs) seeded BAMGs were performed as controls. After surgery, a notable amelioration of graft contracture and recovery of urethral continuity were observed in the Epith-rASCs/BAMG group by retrograde urethrograms and macroscopic inspection. Immunofluorescence revealed that the BrdU-labeled Epith-rASCs/Und-rASCs colocalized with cytokeratin 13 or myosin. Consistent with the results of western blotting, at early postimplantation stage, the continuous epithelial layer with local multilayered structure was observed in the Epith-rASCs/BAMG group, whereas no significant growth and local monolayer growth profile of epithelial cells were observed in the BAMG and Und-rASCs/BAMG group, respectively. The results showed that Epith-rASCs could serve as a potential substitute of urothelium for urethral tissue engineering and be available to prevent lumen contracture and subsequent complications including recurrent stricture. \u00a9 2014 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.", "pid": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1518e0b7"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Hongbin Li", "org": "Deepwater Engineering Research Center, Dalian University of Technology", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fdf4f7"}, {"name": "Weidong Rong", "org": "Deepwater Engineering Research Center, Dalian University of Technology", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e151325cd"}, {"name": "Shi Wang", "org": "Deepwater Engineering Research Center, Dalian University of Technology", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f4f983"}, {"name": "Hong Sun", "org": "Deepwater Engineering Research Center, Dalian University of Technology", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150f3c86"}], "title": "Study on the influence of relative motion between small dimension pile and wave on the structure response", "keywords": ["Morison equation", "Relative motion", "Small dimension pile", "Wave force"], "venue": "Wuhan Ligong Daxue Xuebao (Jiaotong Kexue Yu Gongcheng Ban)/Journal of Wuhan University of Technology (Transportation Science and Engineering)", "year": 2015, "abstract": "Based on airy linear wave theory and Stokes 5th wave theory, a MATLAB program is written to calculate the structure response of small dimension pile under the wave loads considering and not considering the relative motion between the pile and wave.

Traditional color particle filter algorithm cannot actively judge the interference created by similar background, and cause that particle filter estimate by mistakes. So we propose and implement the tracking by using structural similarity as a standard for judging tracking states. We establish unified color scale for background to extract color histogram so that we can real-time track moving target. Further we calculate the average structural similarity between the target and background, which is weighed by particles weight, to establish tracking model. The performance of the considered algorithm which is illustrated through computer simulations shows the improved color particle filter that is more effective when both the moving target and the background are very similar. \u00a92010 IEEE.", "pid": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151b5824"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Hongbin Li", "org": "Key Lab Supramolecular Struct.

Time resolved spectra made it possible to follow large-scale stellar wind variations at timescales as short as an hour. In spite of these observational successes, which inspired a large theoretical effort, the physical cause of these variations is still not known. It is not doubted that rotation plays a key role. A number of worldwide multiwavelength campaigns have been conducted to search for the presence of non-radial pulsations as well as of small surface magnetic fields embedded in the photosphere; these being the two most likely candidates for causing the observed time variability. We report here the main results of such a campaign for the bright O 7.5 giant \u03be Persei, and conclude that for this star non-radial pulsations, if present, are probably not responsible for the strongest periodicity found in the wind. A preliminary upper limit to the magnetic field strength has been derived. The presence of magnetic patches on the stellar surface remains the most promising candidate to give rise to the structures in the stellar wind. New efforts to find the cause of hot-star wind variability should concentrate on photospheric phenomena, which makes simultaneous UV and ground-based observations indispensable. As a spin-off of this work we report the discovery of a new class of wind-variable B stars which resemble well-known magnetic rotators, but for which no magnetic field has yet been measured.", "pid": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e15174980"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Ningning Liu", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Supramolecular Structure and Materials", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fc9c8c"}, {"name": "Bo Peng", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Polymer Physics and Chemistry", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151b5fee"}, {"name": "Yuan Lin", "org": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry and NanoCenter", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ffe22e"}, {"name": "Zhaohui Su", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Polymer Physics and Chemistry", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15026cd5"}, {"name": "Zhongwei Niu", "org": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry and NanoCenter", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151eaedb"}, {"name": "Qian Wang", "org": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry and NanoCenter", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151a498b"}, {"name": "Wenke Zhang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Supramolecular Structure and Materials", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e15073a05"}, {"name": "Hongbin Li", "org": "Department of Chemistry", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151b0c3d"}, {"name": "Jiacong Shen", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Supramolecular Structure and Materials", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15015bac"}], "title": "Pulling genetic RNA out of tobacco mosaic virus using single-molecule force spectroscopy", "venue": "Journal of the American Chemical Society", "year": 2010, "abstract": "RNA-coat protein interactions in intact tobacco mosaic virus have been investigated for the first time directly on the single-molecule level by pulling the genetic RNA step by step out of the helical groove formed by its protein coat.

Methods: Using unified questionnaire, we retrospectively collected the medical records of 1387 confirmed adult PM/DM patients from 2007 to 2012 at 22 rheumatology centers in China. Statistical analyses were performed with chi-square or Fisher exact test and multivariate analyses with logistic regression. Results: A total of 1387 patients were collected with 460(33.2%) PM and 927(66.8%) DM. The female:male ratio was 2.4:1. Their onset age was(47\u00b114) years. A total of 1031 (74.3%) patients had organ involvement. The prevalence of pulmonary involvement, arthritis, gastrointestinal and cardiac involvement were 44.6%, 32.3%, 21.9% and 20.3% respectively. The multivariate analysis indicated that older onset age (P<0.01) was positively associated with pulmonary involvement while myalgia (P<0.05) was negatively associated. Fever (P<0.05), weight loss (P<0.05) and Raynaud's phenomenon (P<0.01) were positively associated with arthritis while muscle weakness (P<0.05) negatively associated. Weight loss (P<0.05), Raynaud's phenomenon (P<0.01) and muscle weakness (P<0.05) were positively associated with gastrointestinal involvement. Weight loss (P<0.05) and swollen limbs (P<0.05) were positively associated with cardiac involvement. Conclusion: The prevalence of organ involvement is high in adult PM/DM patients.

Results: Ten published case-control studies including a total of 1494 cases and 2259 controls were identified. Overall, significant risk effects of Lys751Gln genotype was found under the dominant model (OR = 1.16; 95% CI = 1.01-1.34; P= 0.032). When stratified by clinical types, the variant genotype was associated with the acute myeloid leukemia (AML) risk under the heterozygote comparison (OR = 1.20; 95% CI = 1.00-1.43; P= 0.048), the homozygote comparison (OR = 1.35; 95% CI = 1.05-1.74; P= 0.019) and the dominant model (OR = 1.23; 95% CI = 1.04-1.45; P= 0.015), respectively. Furthermore, significantly increased risks were also pronounced in Caucasian AML patients (the homozygote comparison: OR = 1.38; 95% CI = 1.07-1.78; P= 0.013; the dominant model: OR = 1.23; 95% CI = 1.03-1.46; P= 0.020; and the recessive model: OR = 1.26; 95% CI = 1.00-1.60; P= 0.050). No evident heterogeneities were observed for the overall data under all genetic models. In addition, no statistical evidence for publication bias was found using the method of Begg's and Egger's tests.

The infrared study indicates that the LB films of ES-3 possess crystalline, tightly packed methylene chains and extended interchain hydrogen bonds between the amide groups, which connect the alkyl chains with the microgel. A comparison of the band intensities between the transmission and RA spectra suggests that the hydrocarbon chains are highly oriented with a small tilt angle and that N-H and C=O bonds of the amide groups and the interchain hydrogen bonds between the N-H and C=O bonds are nearly parallel to the surface. It is indicated from infrared spectra of LB films of ES-3 prepared under different surface pressures that the alkyl chains are highly ordered even in the film deposited under nearly zero surface pressure, while the microgel core shows some mobility. The phase transitions have been observed in narrow temperature ranges near 65, 105, and 140\u00b0C for multilayer LB films of ES-3. The three temperatures are very close to those for the phase transitions of bulk materials of ES-3, but the transitions occur more sharply for the LB films. Of note is that the transition temperatures of the LB films are markedly different from those of the self-assembling (SA) films previously reported. This may be due to structural differences in the alkyl chains between the two kinds of films; the SA films have partial interdigitation of the alkyl tails, while the LB films do not have it. In contrast to LB films of low molecular weight organic dyes, even a one-monolayer LB film of ES-3 shows clear phase transitions at slightly higher temperatures. Probably, the microgels prevent the direct interaction between the substrate and the alkyl chains in the first layer, providing the one-monolayer LB film with clear phase transitions.", "pid": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e15060c55"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Hongbin Li", "org": "Key Lab.

Since the single-molecule force spectra of PVAc and PVA in 8 M urea indicate that both behave like ideal entropic springs, the hydrogen bonding of hydroxyl groups in PVA must govern the elastic behaviors of PVA in water. Because of hydrogen bonding, PVA assumes a multiple stranded suprastructure in water. Upon stretching, the suprastructure undergoes a conformational transition to an overstretched state.

These proteins provide the desired elasticity, mechanical strength, resilience, and toughness within these materials. Understanding the mechanical properties of elastomeric protein-based biomaterials is a multiscale problem spanning from the atomistic/molecular level to the macroscopic level. Uncovering the design principles of individual elastomeric building blocks is critical both for the scientific understanding of multiscale mechanics of biomaterials and for the rational engineering of novel biomaterials with desirable mechanical properties. The development of single-molecule force spectroscopy techniques has provided methods for characterizing mechanical properties of elastomeric proteins one molecule at a time. Single-molecule atomic force microscopy (AFM) is uniquely suited to this purpose. Molecular dynamic simulations, protein engineering techniques, and single-molecule AFM study have collectively revealed tremendous insights into the molecular design of single elastomeric proteins, which can guide the design and engineering of elastomeric proteins with tailored mechanical properties. Researchers are focusing experimental efforts toward engineering artificial elastomeric proteins with mechanical properties that mimic or even surpass those of natural elastomeric proteins. In this Account, we summarize our recent experimental efforts to engineer novel artificial elastomeric proteins and develop general and rational methodologies to tune the nanomechanical properties of elastomeric proteins at the single-molecule level. We focus on general design principles used for enhancing the mechanical stability of proteins. These principles include the development of metal-chelation-based general methodology, strategies to control the unfolding hierarchy of multidomain elastomeric proteins, and the design of novel elastomeric proteins that exhibit stimuli-responsive mechanical properties. Moving forward, we are now exploring the use of these artificial elastomeric proteins as building blocks of protein-based biomaterials. Ultimately, we would like to rationally tailor mechanical properties of elastomeric protein-based materials by programming the molecular sequence, and thus nanomechanical properties, of elastomeric proteins at the single-molecule level.

To obviate this problem, here we report a novel two-component approach to engineer tandem modular protein-based hydrogels. This methodology makes use of two complementary leucine zipper sequences (CCE and CCK), which do not self-associate but self-assemble into heterodimeric coiled-coils at neutral pH, as functional groups to drive the self-assembly of protein hydrogels. The two protein components are bifunctional and trifunctional tandem modular proteins carrying the leucine zipper functional groups. We found that the two proteins carrying CCE or CCK can be expressed and purified under native conditions with high yield. Upon mixing, the aqueous solution of the two proteins readily forms a transparent hydrogel. The resultant hydrogel can undergo reversible sol-gel transitions as a function of temperature, and shows much improved erosion properties.

Our results reveal that the mechanical unfolding of AFV3-109 can proceed via multiple parallel unfolding pathways that all cause the protein slipknot to untie and the polypeptide chain to completely extend. These distinct unfolding pathways proceed via either a two- or three-state unfolding process involving the formation of a well-defined, stable intermediate state. SMD simulations predict the same contour length increments for different unfolding pathways as single molecule AFM results, thus providing a plausible molecular mechanism for the mechanical unfolding of AFV3-109. These SMD simulations also reveal that two-state unfolding is initiated from both the N- and C-termini, while three-state unfolding is initiated only from the C-terminus. In both pathways, the protein slipknot was untied during unfolding, and no tightened slipknot conformation was observed. Detailed analysis revealed that interactions between key structural elements lock the knotting loop in place, preventing it from shrinking and the formation of a tightened slipknot conformation.

To do this, a series of loop elongation variants of the small protein GB1, which differ by 2, 5, 10, 15, and 24 amino acid residues, were engineered. Differential measurements of amino acid residue length obtained from different AFM setups result in a precise measure of the length of a single amino acid residue, which varies within different AFM setups because of systematic error between individual AFM piezoelectric calibrations. The measured length of a single amino acid residue from a given AFM setup is then used as a caliper for the given setup to eliminate systematic error, leading to highly accurate and precise measurements of the number of amino acid residues that are involved in a conformation change of a polypeptide chain. We further developed a more precise, robust, and model-free method to determine the apparent size of single amino acid residues and conformational changes of proteins. This method improves the accuracy of single protein force spectroscopy measurements, providing an accurate means of measuring force-induced protein conformational changes. \u00a9 2014 American Chemical Society.", "pid": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fabf6a"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Yurui Xue", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Supramolecular Structure and Materials, College of Chemistry, Jilin University", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15110871"}, {"name": "Xun Li", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Supramolecular Structure and Materials, College of Chemistry, Jilin University", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151ce8ba"}, {"name": "Hongbin Li", "org": "Department of Chemistry, University of British Columbia", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151b0c3d"}, {"name": "Wenke Zhang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Supramolecular Structure and Materials, College of Chemistry, Jilin University", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e15073a05"}], "title": "Quantifying thiol-gold interactions towards the efficient strength control", "venue": "Nature Communications", "year": 2014, "abstract": "The strength of the thiol-gold interactions provides the basis to fabricate robust self-assembled monolayers for diverse applications.

Here we use atomic force microscopy to quantify the stability of individual thiol-gold contacts formed both by isolated single thiols and in self-assembled monolayers on gold surface. Our results show that the oxidized gold surface can enhance greatly the stability of gold-thiol contacts. In addition, the shift of binding modes from a coordinate bond to a covalent bond with the change in environmental pH and interaction time has been observed experimentally. Furthermore, isolated thiol-gold contact is found to be more stable than that in self-assembled monolayers. Our findings revealed mechanisms to control the strength of thiol-gold contacts and will help guide the design of thiol-gold contacts for a variety of practical applications. \u00a9 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The direct elucidation of the thermodynamic, structural and functional consequences of protein-ligand interactions is thus of critical importance to decipher the mechanism underlying these biological processes. A toolbox containing a variety of powerful techniques has been developed to quantitatively study protein-ligand interactions in vitro as well as in living systems. The development of atomic force microscopy-based single molecule force spectroscopy techniques has expanded this toolbox and made it possible to directly probe the mechanical consequence of ligand binding on proteins. Many recent experiments have revealed how ligand binding affects the mechanical stability and mechanical unfolding dynamics of proteins, and provided mechanistic understanding on these effects. The enhancement effect of mechanical stability by ligand binding has been used to help tune the mechanical stability of proteins in a rational manner and develop novel functional binding assays for protein-ligand interactions.

In this paper, we present robust channel estimation and MUD techniques for multicarrier (MC) CDMA by explicitly taking into account such estimation errors. The proposed techniques are obtained by optimizing the worst case performance over two bounded uncertainty sets pertaining to the two types of estimation errors. We show that although the estimation errors associated with the prior channel estimate and the sample covariance matrix are generally not bounded, it is beneficial to optimize the worst case performance over properly chosen bounded uncertainty sets determined by a parameter called bounding probability.

As such, the shortest coherence time of the channel that can be handled is reduced, which makes the differential SF scheme more resistant to fast fading. Along with a suitable spectral encoder and interleaver, both the differential ST and SF schemes offer joint spatio-spectral diversity and coding gain.

This paper employs the conjugate-gradient (CG) algorithm to solve the linear prediction problem arising in the PAMF detector. It is shown that CG yields not only a new computationally efficient implementation of the PAMF detector, a new and efficient AR model order selection method that can naturally be integrated with CG iterations, but it also offers new perspectives of PAMF as a reduced-rank subspace detector.

We first consider a general case involving an arbitrary covariance matrix of the disturbance (including interference, noise, etc.) and show that all CG-MF detectors attain constant false alarm rate (CFAR) and, furthermore, are optimum in the sense that the kth CG-MF detector yields the highest output signal-to-interference-and- noise ratio (SINR) among all linear detectors within the k th Krylov subspace.

We show that the (r+1)st CG-MF detector achieves CFAR and an output SINR nearly identical to that of the MF detector which requires complete iterations of the CG algorithm till reaching convergence. Hence, the (r+1)st CG-MF detector can be used in place of the MF detector for significant computational saving when r is small.

The localisation is performed based on the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) readings collected from the messages exchanged between nodes. We use the RSSI as a rough estimate of the inverse of distance between any pair of communicating nodes, and we claim that such estimates provide a coarse information of the nodes relative localisation that is still suitable to support several coordination tasks. In addition, we introduce a relative velocity estimation framework based on the RSSI measurements. This framework uses consecutive distance measurements and position estimates to provide the relative velocity vectors for all the nodes in the network. To accomplish this, we propose using a Kalman filter and the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to generate smooth RSSI pairwise signal distance for all nodes. Then we use Multidimensional Scaling to obtain relative positions from the pairwise distances. Finally, due to anchor unavailability, relative positions are adjusted to reflect the continuous mobility by using geometric transformations, thus obtaining smoother trajectories for mobile nodes. This allows us to estimate velocity and to establish a correspondence between orientation in the physical world and in the relative coordinates system. Additionally, we study the impact of several parameters in calculating the network topology, namely different approaches to provide a symmetric distances matrix, the period of the matrix dissemination, the use of synchronisation of the transmissions, and the filtering of the RSSI data. Experimental results, with a set of MicaZ motes, show that the period of matrix dissemination is the most relevant of the parameters, specifically with larger periods providing the best results, however, shorter periods are shown to be possible as long as the transmissions are synchronised. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The other popular strategy is to use the square of the difference between the actual and expected water flow as the objective function. While the constraints are only the high-efficiency ranges of pumps, the obtained model does not match the actual operation properly.

According to our survey of 670 firms in 15 randomly selected counties in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, more than half of the firms owned by local government were completely privatized by 1999. The privatization process is striking for two reasons. First, local governments almost always sold firms to insiders, while in the rest of the world privatization largely involves outsiders. Secondly, unlike the predictions of some academics and policy makers, many privatized firms have experienced an increase in performance. Drawing on firm-level survey data and extensive interviews with government leaders and managers, we found that leaders devised a way to elicit information from the buyer at the time of the sale about the firm's future profitability that enabled them to execute privatization successfully.

Our findings support the view that the institutional environment shapes the private entrepreneur's motivation to participate in politics; they also provide an example of how private entrepreneurs respond to state/market failure in developing and transition countries. \u00a9 Western Economic Association Inernational.", "pid": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f69197"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Hongbin Li", "org": "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150fb49f"}, {"name": "Yi Zhu", "org": "Michigan State University", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15013054"}], "title": "Income, income inequality, and health: Evidence from China", "keywords": ["China", "Health", "Inequality"], "venue": "Journal of Comparative Economics", "year": 2006, "abstract": "This paper tests using survey data from China whether individual health is associated with income and community-level income inequality. Although poor health and high inequality are key features of many developing countries, most of the earlier literature has drawn on data from developed countries in studying the association between the two. We find that self-reported health status increases with per capita income, but at a decreasing rate. Controlling for per capita income, we find an inverted-U association between self-reported health status and income inequality, which suggests that high inequality in a community poses threats to health. We also find that high inequality increases the probability of health-compromising behavior such as smoking and alcohol consumption. Most of our findings are robust to different measures of health status and income inequality.

We also find that the negative effect of income inequality on consumption is stronger for poorer and younger people and that income inequality stimulates more education investment, which are consistent with the status-seeking hypothesis. \u00a9 2010 Association for Comparative Economic Studies.", "pid": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15120907"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Hongbin Li", "org": "School of Economics and Management", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150fb49f"}, {"name": "Lingsheng Meng", "org": "School of Economics and Management", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e15142cb9"}, {"name": "Wenqing Pan", "org": "School of Economics and Management", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150a03d7"}], "title": "The human cost of China's industrial growth", "keywords": ["China", "Fatality", "Growth"], "venue": "China Economic Review", "year": 2011, "abstract": "This paper examines whether industrial growth during economic development is associated with a high workplace fatality rate by using panel data from China.

Using the 1990 census, we find that the strict enforcement of the one-child policy led to 4.4 extra boys per 100 girls in the 1980s, accounting for about 94% of the total increase in sex ratios during this period. The robust tests indicate that the estimated policy effect is not likely confounded by other omitted policy shocks or socioeconomic changes. Moreover, we conduct the DD estimation using both the 2000 census and the 2005 mini-census.

Our findings indicate that there is a great deal of benefit in supporting microcredit programs. \u00a9 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.", "pid": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1508fc13"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Xiongzhu Bu", "org": "School of Mechanical Engineering", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151d7510"}, {"name": "Hongbin Li", "org": "School of Mechanical Engineering", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f6b362"}, {"name": "Yongxin Li", "org": "School of Mechanical Engineering", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ff6fc1"}], "title": "The Application of Wavelet Analysis on Modeling of the Pressure Transducer", "venue": "Proceedings of the International Symposium on Test and Measurement", "year": 2003, "abstract": "It is a general method that is to obtain dynamic characteristic of high-pressure transducer using dynamic calibrating methods.

Conventional calibration methods have been using an electromagnetic CT which contains an iron core as the standard CT. The iron core is big and difficult to manufacture for high-current measurement, and the serious residual magnetism of the iron core at high currents can lead to excessive measurement errors. This paper proposes a calibration system based on indirect comparison of CT and Rogowski coil, i.e. using an iron-core CT to correct the error of the Rogowski coil at low currents, which may be caused by the position of the current-carrying conductor and so on, and then using the calibrated Rogowski coil as the standard transformer at high currents for its good linearity and wide dynamic range, and there is no magnetic saturation. Since the output of the Rogowski coil needs to be integrated, an improved digital integrator based on direct current (dc) negative feedback is adopted, which can effectively eliminate the influences of temperature drift, time drift and dc offset caused by the analogue circuit. The measurement errors of each part of the calibration system have also been discussed, and the test results show that the accuracy of the system can reach up to the 0.05S Class and the uncertainties are 0.038% for ratio and 0.68\u2032 for phase in the range 500 A to 50 kA. \u00a9 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.", "pid": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e15071cc6"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Zhenhua Li", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Advanced Electromagnetic Engineering and Technology", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151f25f2"}, {"name": "Hongbin Li", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Advanced Electromagnetic Engineering and Technology", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150fc6d3"}, {"name": "Zhi Zhang", "org": "CEEE of Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f6084d"}, {"name": "Pandian Luo", "org": "CEEE of Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15113a23"}], "title": "An Online Calibration Method for Electronic Voltage Transformers Based on IEC 61850-9-2", "keywords": ["Digital output", "Electronic voltage transformers", "Online calibration", "Two-order Hanning self-convolution window"], "venue": "Mapan - Journal of Metrology Society of India", "year": 2014, "abstract": "Since electronic voltage transformers (EVTs) based on IEC 61850-9-2 are widely used in the substations, especially in the automating substations, their calibration becomes very important.

For this reason, an online calibration system is proposed in this paper. By employing a specially designed remote-controlled hoisting unit and standard voltage transformer, the proposed system can calibrate EVTs without interrupting the power service and the power outage can be avoided.

In existing test specification for the merging unit the content related to the measurement error is drafted by reference to the standard for the electronic instrument transformer, so it is hard to meet the requirement of metering performance test for the metering performance of the merging unit, therefore the development of digital electric energy metering technique is restricted. To research the metering performance of the analog-input merging unit, from the respective to the signal flow the element causing the error in the analog-input merging unit is analyzed and the similarities and differences among the structures of analog-input merging unit, electronic transformers and electronic watt-hour meter are compared and the factors impacting the metering performance error are summarized. Taking the basic error for example, according to different standards the single-phase and three-phase error tests for two analog-input merging units with nominal accuracy of 0.2% respectively produced by different manufacturers are performed. The test data show that there are differences between the results of single-phase measurement and the results of three-phase simultaneous measurement, it means that there are influences among the channels and the smaller the input signal, the greater the interaction is. In allusion to the defect in existing testing standard for the merging unit that the measurement results cannot correctly reflect the metering performances, it is suggested that during the assessment on the metering performance of the analog-input merging unit, not only the testing standard for the electronic transformer should be referred, but also the verification regulation for electronic watt-hour meter should be referred, and the testing items related to the metering performance should be added to perfect the related testing specification of the merging unit for the measurement.", "pid": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f8e952"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Qingqin Feng", "org": "Anyang Teacher's College", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fc8799"}, {"name": "Cunjiang Hao", "org": "Anyang Teacher's College", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151b489f"}, {"name": "Jiongliang Yuan", "org": "China National Cleaner Production Center", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f4d007"}, {"name": "Yumin Han", "org": "Anyang Teacher's College", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15037cd7"}, {"name": "Jinfu Guo", "org": "Anyang Teacher's College", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1502c43a"}, {"name": "Hongbin Li", "org": "Anyang Teacher's College", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150dc7f5"}, {"name": "Huiyun Li", "org": "Anyang Teacher's College", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151b0365"}], "title": "Preparation of nanometer \u03b3-Al2O3 powers and their adsorption behaviors to various kinds of phosphate anions", "keywords": ["Adsorption", "Nanometer \u03b3-Al2O3 powders", "Phosphate anions.", "Sol-gel method"], "venue": "Lizi Jiaohuan Yu Xifu/Ion Exchange and Adsorption", "year": 2005, "abstract": "The nanometer \u03b3-Al", "pid": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e1520013b"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Hongbin Li", "org": "Graduate School of the Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e1520d69a"}, {"name": "Jichuan Zhang", "org": "Graduate School of the Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1508cbd2"}, {"name": "Wenyong Xiong", "org": "Graduate School of the Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15039482"}, {"name": "Tianle Xu", "org": "Institute of Neuroscience", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1505bceb"}, {"name": "Jun Cao", "org": "Graduate School of the Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ffb940"}, {"name": "Lin Xu", "org": "Mental Health Institute", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f767ed"}], "title": "Long-term depression in rat CA1-subicular synapses depends on the G-protein coupled mACh receptors", "keywords": ["Calcium", "G-protein", "Long-term depression (LTD)", "Muscarinic receptor", "Subiculum"], "venue": "Neuroscience Research", "year": 2005, "abstract": "The subiculum, which is the primary target of CA1 pyramidal neurons and sending efferent fibres to many brain regions, serves as a hippocampal interface in the neural information processes between hippocampal formation and neocortex.

We found that propofol in suppressing whole-cell excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSC) was more effective in 21 day old rats than either in 7 day old rats or under the condition of high intracellular chloride concentration in 21 day old rats. Furthermore, the propofol concentration to facilitate the NMDA receptor-dependent LTD was lower at postnatal day 21 than at postnatal day 7. Interestingly, the decay time of EPSC was decreased during the development from postnatal day 7 to 21, but it was increased by the recording condition of high intracellular chloride concentration or by propofol administration.

The transgenic fibroblasts were cultured until confluent and then serum-starved prior to be used as nuclear donors. After nuclear transfer and activation, 22% (12/55) of the transgenic cloned embryos developed to the blastocyst stage. A total of 114 embryos at the 4- to 8-cell stage were transferred to the oviducts of 8 pseudo-pregnant mothers; 5 of these animals became pregnant, and 3 of the 5 mother rabbits carried the pregnancy to term. Caesarean section was performed on the 3 pregnant mothers, yielding 4 kits, one of which has survived for more than 9 months. Green fluorescence could be detected in the toenails of the living cloned rabbit and the offspring from the living cloned rabbit under ultraviolet light. DNA analyses confirmed that all 4 cloned rabbits were genetically identical to the transgenic donor cells, and that they all carried the EGFP gene. The present study demonstrated that transgenic rabbits can be generated through nuclear transfer.

Additionally, the molecular mechanisms of myostatin in myofiber hyperplasia at the fetal stage in sheep remain unknown. Using the first specialized transcriptome-wide sheep oligo DNA microarray and histological methods, we investigated the gene expression profile and histological characteristics of developing fetal ovine longissimus muscle in Texel sheep (high muscle and low fat), as a myostatin model of natural mutation, and Ujumqin sheep (low muscle and high fat). Fetal skeletal muscles were sampled at 70, 85, 100, 120, and 135 d of gestation.Results: Myofiber number increased sharply with a pulsed-wave mode at certain developmental stages but was not augmented evenly across developmental stages in fetal sheep. The surges in myofiber hyperplasia occurred at 85 and 120 d in Texel sheep, whereas a unique proliferative surge appeared at 100 d in Ujumqin sheep. Analysis of the microarray demonstrated that immune and hematological systems' development and function, lipid metabolism, and cell communication were the biological functions that were most differentially expressed between Texel and Ujumqin sheep during muscle development. Pathways associated with myogenesis and the proliferation of myoblasts, such as calcium signaling, chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 signaling, and vascular endothelial growth factor signaling, were affected significantly at specific fetal stages, which underpinned fetal myofiber hyperplasia and postnatal muscle hypertrophy. Moreover, we identified some differentially expressed genes between the two breeds that could be potential myostatin targets for further investigation.Conclusions: Proliferation of myofibers proceeded in a pulsed-wave mode at particular fetal stages in the sheep. The myostatin mutation changed the gene expression pattern in skeletal muscle at a transcriptome-wide level, resulting in variation in myofiber phenotype between Texel and Ujumqin sheep during the second half of gestation. Our findings provide a novel and dynamic description of the effect of myostatin on skeletal muscle development, which contributes to understanding the biology of muscle development in large mammals. \u00a9 2011 Ren et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "pid": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e15073611"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Xihui Sheng", "org": "College of Veterinary Medicine", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1512cbe9"}, {"name": "Xuemei Song", "org": "Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Science", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150e3311"}, {"name": "Yan Yu", "org": "Reproductive Medical Center", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151b1baf"}, {"name": "Lili Niu", "org": "Division of Applied Life Science", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150d6183"}, {"name": "Shangang Li", "org": "Department of Laboratory Animal Sciences", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1508f4dc"}, {"name": "Hongbin Li", "org": "Institute of Zoology", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e150386f8"}, {"name": "Caihong Wei", "org": "National Center for Molecular Genetics and Breeding of Animal", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150dafb7"}, {"name": "Tao Liu", "org": "National Center for Molecular Genetics and Breeding of Animal", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e15060132"}, {"name": "Li Zhang", "org": "National Center for Molecular Genetics and Breeding of Animal", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150c0e50"}, {"name": "Lixin Du", "org": "National Center for Molecular Genetics and Breeding of Animal", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e1510442b"}], "title": "Characterization of microRNAs from sheep (Ovis aries) using computational and experimental analyses", "keywords": ["Expressed sequence tag (EST)", "MicroRNA", "MicroRNA*", "Sheep", "Small cDNA library", "Target gene"], "venue": "Molecular Biology Reports", "year": 2011, "abstract": "Ovis aries is one of the most important agricultural livestock for meat production, and also is an ideal model organism for biological and comparative genomics studies.

To analyze the spectrum and risk factors of rheumatic manifestations in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Methods. Ninety-eight consecutive inpatients with HIV infection admitted to Peking Union Medical College Hospital from 1999 to 2006 were studied. Demographic data, routes of transmission, clinical features, and laboratory findings were collected and a database was established. Laboratory studies included blood CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD19+, CD16+CD3+, CD4+CD28+, CD8+CD28+, HLA-DR+CD8+, and CD8+CD38+ lymphocyte counts, and antinuclear antibody tests. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection was also investigated in each patient. Risk factors for the rheumatic manifestations of HIV infection were assessed by logistic regression analysis. Results. Rheumatic manifestations were found in 53 (54.08%) HIV patients. Vasculitis was the most common finding (20 cases; 20.41%), including 15 cases of Beh\u00e7et-like disease, 2 cases each of Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura and digital gangrene, and one case of central nervous system vasculitis. Other common rheumatic manifestations included Sj\u00f6gren-like syndrome/diffuse infiltrative lymphocytosis syndrome (DILS; 11 cases; 11.22%), lupus-like syndrome (10 cases; 10.20%), of which 5 cases had renal involvement, and myositis (8 cases; 8.16%) including one case of zidovudine-induced myositis. No case of spondyloarthropathy was observed. Logistic regression analysis showed that Centers for Disease Control CD4+ T cell staging, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and HCV infection were risk factors for HIV patients to develop rheumatic manifestations [p = 0.01, odds ratio (OR) = 31.80; p = 0.02, OR = 2.93; p = 0.01, OR = 17.47, respectively]. Conclusion. Rheumatic disorders such as vasculitis, Sj\u00f6gren-like syndrome/DILS, lupus-like syndrome, and myositis were common in Chinese patients with HIV, while articular disorders were rare.

CTC-positive breast cancers were significantly associated with high histological grade (HR = 1.21 [95% CI 1.09-1.35], n = 34, P < 0.0001), tumor size (>2 cm) (HR = 1.12 [95% CI 1.02-1.22], n = 31, P = 0.01). and nodal status (\u22651) (HR = 1.10 [95% CI 1.00-1.21], n = 32, P = 0.037), but cytokeratin-19 (CK-19) mRNA-positive CTCs were not associated with these clinicopathological parameters of breast cancer. Furthermore, the presence of CTCs was not associated with estrogen receptor (ER) negativity, progesterone receptor (PR) negativity, or human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) positivity. Detection of CTCs in the PB indicates poor prognosis in patients with primary breast cancer. Larger clinical studies are required to further evaluate the role of these markers in clinical practice. \u00a9 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.", "pid": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f72fd0"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Shu Zhao", "org": "Department of Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150e78fa"}, {"name": "Huike Yang", "org": "Department of Anatomy", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151c08c2"}, {"name": "Minghui Zhang", "org": "Department of Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433e3e1cd8e4e15f435e4"}, {"name": "Dekai Zhang", "org": "Center for Infectious and Inflammatory Diseases at the Institute of Biosciences and Technology", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fd27a9"}, {"name": "Yupeng Liu", "org": "Department of Epidemiology", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150dd7c3"}, {"name": "Yan Liu", "org": "Department of Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1502b3d1"}, {"name": "Ying Song", "org": "Department of Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e15089690"}, {"name": "Xiaosan Zhang", "org": "Department of Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150d2f94"}, {"name": "Hongbin Li", "org": "Department of Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fb9685"}, {"name": "Wenjie Ma", "org": "Department of Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151c313f"}, {"name": "Qingyuan Zhang", "org": "Department of Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e15099bc4"}], "title": "Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) Detected by Triple-Marker EpCAM, CK19, and hMAM RT-PCR and Their Relation to Clinical Outcome in Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients", "keywords": ["Breast cancer", "Circulating tumor cells", "CK19", "EpCAM", "hMAM", "Triple-marker"], "venue": "Cell Biochemistry and Biophysics", "year": 2013, "abstract": "In order to investigate the prognostic value of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC), the blood cells from 98 MBC patients and 60 controls were evaluated by RT-PCR to detect the presence of markers EpCAM, CK19, and hMAM. Peripheral blood was obtained from all patients with MBC before any systemic therapy. Immunofluorescence staining experiment was conducted on CTCs samples from 10 patients to investigate the coexpression of EpCAM, CK19, and hMAM. In addition, analyses were carried out for their correlation with patients' clinicopathologic features. EpCAM+, CK19+, and hMAM+ cells were detected in 50 (51. 0 %), 43 (43. 9 %), and 68 (69. 4 %) of the 98 patients, respectively. Triple-marker-positive CTCs were detected in 86 of 98 (87. 8 %) patients with a significantly higher rate than the control group. Among the 98 patients, 12 (12. 2 %) patients were negative for three genes, 34 (34. 7 %) positive for one gene, 29 (29. 6 %) positive for any two genes, and 23 (23. 5 %) positive for all three genes. Compared to single-marker detection, the triple combined marker detection exhibited significantly higher rate. Furthermore, the specificity of triple combined markers of serial test was 100 %. The expression of three genes was significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis, high histological grade, and high levels of serum CA153 and CEA. Double-immunofluorescence labeling confirmed the presence of following CTCs phenotypes: CK19+/hMAM+, CK19+/hMAM-, CK19-/hMAM+, CK19+/EpCAM+, CK19-/EpCAM+, CK19+/EpCAM-, hMAM+/EpCAM+, and hMAM+/EpCAM-. After 2 years of follow-up, the presence of CTCs with triple-marker positive in peripheral blood was an independent risk factor for reduced progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), and the presence of CTCs before any chemotherapy predicts poor OS and PFS in patients with MBC. \u00a9 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.", "pid": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1509acae"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Jian Zheng", "org": "Soochow University Laboratory of Cancer Molecular Genetics", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151ceee1"}, {"name": "Jieqiong Deng", "org": "Soochow University Laboratory of Cancer Molecular Genetics", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e15051af8"}, {"name": "Lan Jiang", "org": "Soochow University Laboratory of Cancer Molecular Genetics", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151ceb91"}, {"name": "Lei Yang", "org": "The Institute for Chemical Carcinogenesis", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151a3ede"}, {"name": "Yonghe You", "org": "Soochow University Laboratory of Cancer Molecular Genetics", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e15172b2c"}, {"name": "Min Hu", "org": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1515bb17"}, {"name": "Na Li", "org": "Soochow University Laboratory of Cancer Molecular Genetics", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f63bc7"}, {"name": "Hongchun Wu", "org": "Soochow University Laboratory of Cancer Molecular Genetics", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f557a0"}, {"name": "Wei Li", "org": "Soochow University Laboratory of Cancer Molecular Genetics", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e1519fa59"}, {"name": "Hongbin Li", "org": "Department of Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fb9685"}, {"name": "Jiachun Lu", "org": "The Institute for Chemical Carcinogenesis", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fbdef2"}, {"name": "Yifeng Zhou", "org": "Soochow University Laboratory of Cancer Molecular Genetics", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e1520a83c"}], "title": "Heterozygous Genetic Variations of FOXP3 in Xp11.23 Elevate Breast Cancer Risk in Chinese Population via Skewed X-Chromosome Inactivation", "keywords": ["Breast cancer", "Cancer immunity", "FOXP3", "Genetic susceptibility"], "venue": "Human Mutation", "year": 2013, "abstract": "FOXP3 (forkhead box P3: also known as IPEX, XPID) is not only a hallmark of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs), but also an X-linked breast cancer suppressor gene expressed in tumor cells. A two-stage investigation was conducted in individuals from northern, southern and eastern China. Individuals carrying a FOXP3 rs2294021CT genotype showed about 1.5-fold increased risk of breast cancer compared with TT carriers. In a related biochemical assay, the rs2294021C allele was found to significantly enhance transcription activity, leading to higher mRNA levels of FOXP3 compared with T allele. Moreover, the number of Tregs and its corresponding interleukin-10 (IL-10) secretion were elevated whereas the proliferation of antitumor T cells was decreased in the C-allele carriers. The breast cancer oncogenes Her-2/ErbB2 and Skp2 were also found to be significantly inhibited in C-allele carriers. Moreover, skewed X-chromosome inactivation (SXCI) analysis showed that rs2294021CT carriers with SXCI showed higher risk than the homozygous carriers and CT carriers without SXCI, suggesting a possible interaction between the rs2294021CT genotype and SXCI. Taken together, these findings indicate that the rs2294021CT genotype may increase an individual's susceptibility to breast cancer by breaking the balance between Treg-mediated immune tolerance and FOXP3-controlled tumor-suppressive effect. \u00a9 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "pid": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f610f4"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Lei Yang", "org": "The Institute for Chemical Carcinogenesis", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151a3ede"}, {"name": "Bin Liu", "org": "Guangzhou No.12 Hospital affiliated to Guangzhou Medical University", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150b9715"}, {"name": "Binfang Huang", "org": "Guangzhou No.12 Hospital affiliated to Guangzhou Medical University", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151a20e0"}, {"name": "Jieqiong Deng", "org": "Soochow University Laboratory of Cancer Molecular Genetics", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e15051af8"}, {"name": "Hongbin Li", "org": "Department of Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fb9685"}, {"name": "Bolan Yu", "org": "The Key Laboratory for Major Obstetric Diseases of Guangdong Province", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e15153704"}, {"name": "Fuman Qiu", "org": "The Institute for Chemical Carcinogenesis", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e151fd3af"}, {"name": "Mei Cheng", "org": "The Institute for Chemical Carcinogenesis", "id": "5b5433e3e1cd8e4e15f44f12"}, {"name": "Hui Wang", "org": "The Institute for Chemical Carcinogenesis", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e1520c2de"}, {"name": "Rongrong Yang", "org": "The Institute for Chemical Carcinogenesis", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e151492b3"}, {"name": "Xiaorong Yang", "org": "The Institute for Chemical Carcinogenesis", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f51e22"}, {"name": "Yifeng Zhou", "org": "Soochow University Laboratory of Cancer Molecular Genetics", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e1520a83c"}, {"name": "Jiachun Lu", "org": "The Institute for Chemical Carcinogenesis", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fbdef2"}], "title": "A functional copy number variation in the WWOX gene is associated with lung cancer risk in Chinese", "venue": "Human Molecular Genetics", "year": 2013, "abstract": "WW domain-containing oxidoreductase (WWOX) is a tumor suppressor that has been reported to lose function due to genetic alterations in several cancers.

Thus far, a subset of breast cancer genetic susceptibility loci has been addressed among Asian woman through genome-wide association studies (GWASs). In this study, we identified numerous long, intergenic, noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) enriched in these breast cancer risk-related loci and identified 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located within the sequences of lincRNA exonic regions. We examined whether these 16 SNPs are associated with breast cancer risk in 2539 cancer patients and 2818 control subjects from eastern, southern, and northern Chinese populations. We found that the C allele of the rs12325489C>T polymorphism in the exonic regions of lincRNA-ENST00000515084 was associated with a significantly increased risk of breast cancer (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.79; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.50-2.12), compared with the rs12325489TT genotype. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that the C to T base change at rs12325489C>T disrupts the binding site for miRNA-370, thereby influencing the transcriptional activity of lincRNA-ENST00000515084 in vitro and in vivo, and affecting cell proliferation and tumor growth.

The results showed that the establishment of an epithelial-specific microenvironment may be a feasible way for epithelial differentiation of ASCs in vitro, and provided an alternative for research on epithelium regeneration. \u00a9 Copyright 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.", "pid": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fa2a2f"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Kun Liu", "org": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1517f9ca"}, {"name": "Lianjie Zhu", "org": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e15211338"}, {"name": "Naixuan Li", "org": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e15147298"}, {"name": "Youguang Sun", "org": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15038d3c"}, {"name": "Hongbin Li", "org": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151bed6e"}, {"name": "Xuchen Zhu", "org": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e15045bbc"}], "title": "Solvothermal synthesis of mesoporous slabstone-like TiO 2 and its photodegradation preference in a methyl orange-rhodamine B mixture solution", "keywords": ["organic pollutant", "photodegradation", "slabstone-like TiO 2", "solvothermal synthesis"], "venue": "Crystal Research and Technology", "year": 2012, "abstract": "Mesoporous slabstone-like anatase TiO ", "pid": "5b5433e3e1cd8e4e15f47379"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Lianjie Zhu", "org": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e15211338"}, {"name": "Kun Liu", "org": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1517f9ca"}, {"name": "Hongbin Li", "org": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151bed6e"}, {"name": "Youguang Sun", "org": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15038d3c"}, {"name": "Mo Qiu", "org": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1514dd91"}], "title": "Solvothermal synthesis of mesoporous TiO2 microspheres and their excellent photocatalytic performance under simulated sunlight irradiation", "keywords": ["Mesoporous materials", "Organic pollutant", "Photodegradation", "Solvothermal synthesis", "TiO2 microspheres"], "venue": "Solid State Sciences", "year": 2013, "abstract": "TiO", "pid": "5b5433e3e1cd8e4e15f415e4"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Hongbin Li", "org": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151bed6e"}, {"name": "Lianjie Zhu", "org": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e15211338"}, {"name": "Chunyan Ma", "org": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151db628"}, {"name": "Huili Zhang", "org": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering", "id": "5b5433e3e1cd8e4e15f45bf2"}], "title": "TiO", "keywords": ["Catalysts", "Nanostructures", "Photodegradation selectivity", "Transition metal compounds"], "venue": "Monatshefte fur Chemie", "year": 2014, "abstract": "The photocatalytic properties of TiO", "pid": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151d8e71"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Yinglong Sa", "org": "Department of Urology, Shanghai Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151c45a7"}, {"name": "Chao Li", "org": "Department of Urology, Shanghai Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e150112e6"}, {"name": "Hongbin Li", "org": "Department of Urology, Shanghai Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151bed6e"}, {"name": "Hailin Guo", "org": "Department of Urology, Shanghai Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1504d8b2"}], "title": "TIMP-1 induces \u03b1-smooth muscle actin in fibroblasts to promote urethral scar formation", "keywords": ["Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)", "Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1)", "Transforming growth factor \u03b2 1 (TGF\u03b21)", "Urethral scar", "\u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA)"], "venue": "Cellular Physiology and Biochemistry", "year": 2015, "abstract": "Background/Aims: Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) has been reported to upregulate in urethral scar. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain undefined. Methods: Here, we studied levels of TIMP-1 and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) in the fibroblasts isolated from urethral scar tissues, compared to the fibroblasts isolated from normal urethra. Then we either overexpressed TIMP-1, or inhibited TIMP-1 by lentiviruses carrying a transgene or a short hairpin small interfering RNA for TIMP-1 in human fibroblasts. We examined the effects of modulation of TIMP-1 on \u03b1-SMA, and on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes. We also studied the underlying mechanisms. Results: We detected significantly higher levels of TIMP-1 and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) in the fibroblasts isolated from urethral scar tissues, compared to the fibroblasts isolated from normal urethra. Moreover, the levels of TIMP-1 and \u03b1-SMA strongly correlated. Moreover, we found that TIMP-1 significantly increased levels of \u03b1-SMA, transforming growth factor \u03b2 1 (TGF\u03b21), Collagen I and some other key factors related to an enhanced EMT, suggesting that TIMP-1 may induce transformation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts to promote tissue EMT to enhance the formation of urethral scar. Moreover, increases in TIMP-1 also induced an increase in fibroblast cell growth and cell invasion, in an ERK/MAPK-signaling-dependent manner.

For the first step, the median of local displacement difference is computed and compared with a threshold deduced according to the application parameters such as the maximum tissue strain, the signal-to-noise ratio of the displacement estimation (SNRe), and the dimensions of the local window. If the median is larger than the threshold, the displacement point is deemed an outlier. For the second step, the displacement outlier is replaced with the median of the displacement points in a local region. The results from the experiments with theoretical data contaminated by artificial outliers show that the proposed method is effective in removing the displacement outliers when the outlier points is not more than a reasonable ratio in all the displacement points.

Further experiment indicates that, for a deficiently degaussed current transformer, its remanence factor is 0.189 measured by traditional DC method and 0.234 measured by the proposed DC method, showing that the traditional DC method leads to deviation of -21% while the proposed novel DC method overcomes the deviation.", "pid": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e151518c8"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Yi Tang", "org": "Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e15059304"}, {"name": "Bo Jiang", "org": "State Grid Sichuan Electric Power Corporation Metering Center", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151d5e95"}, {"name": "Hongbin Li", "org": "Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f712a3"}], "title": "Handling methods for sampled value frame missing in digital power metering", "keywords": ["Digital power metering", "IEC61850", "Interpolation algorithm", "Sampling value frame missing"], "venue": "Diangong Jishu Xuebao/Transactions of China Electrotechnical Society", "year": 2014, "abstract": "Compared to conventional power metering system, sampled value frame missing is a new technical issue introduced by digital power metering system.

The virus is highly pathogenic, manifesting in infected patients with an approximately 50% fatality rate. It is known that the surface spike (S) proteins of coronaviruses mediate receptor recognition and membrane fusion, thereby playing an indispensable role in initiating infection. In this process, heptad repeats 1 and 2 (HR1 and HR2) of the S protein assemble into a complex called the fusion core, which represents a key membrane fusion architecture. To date, however, the MERS-CoV fusion core remains uncharacterized. In this study, we performed a series of biochemical and biophysical analyses characterizing the HR1/HR2 complexes of this novel virus. The HR sequences were variably truncated and then connected with a flexible amino acid linker. In each case, the recombinant protein automatically assembled into a trimer in solution, displaying a typical \u03b1-helical structure. One of these trimers was successfully crystallized, and its structure was solved at a resolution of 1.9 \u00c5. A canonical 6-helix bundle, like those reported for other coronaviruses, was revealed, with three HR1 helices forming the central coiled-coil core and three HR2 chains surrounding the core in the HR1 side grooves. This demonstrates that MERS-CoV utilizes a mechanism similar to those of other class I enveloped viruses for membrane fusion. With this notion, we further identified an HR2-based peptide that could potently inhibit MERS-CoV fusion and entry by using a pseudotyped-virus system. These results lay the groundwork for future inhibitory peptidic drug design. \u00a9 2013, American Society for Microbiology.", "pid": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1517d5cc"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Wei Wang", "org": "Institute of Microbiology", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15feb1da"}, {"name": "Yiwei Liu", "org": "Institute of Microbiology", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150f36c7"}, {"name": "Hongbin Li", "org": "Institute of Microbiology", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e1500a04b"}], "title": "A method to determine the structure of the complex of enzyme and its substrate using 6-phosphate-\u03b2-glucosidase at low temperature", "keywords": ["6-phosphate-\u03b2-glucosidase (BglA)", "Crystal", "Diffraction data", "Low temperature", "Substrate electron-density map"], "venue": "Shengwu Gongcheng Xuebao/Chinese Journal of Biotechnology", "year": 2013, "abstract": "To capture a state of the enzyme in complex with an intact substrate, we developed and adopted a novel freezing method in crystal preparation procedure.

The two proteins share overall structural similarity, but differ distinctly in the DNA-binding region between \u03b23- and \u03b24-strands. While Sul7d possesses a hinge of two amino acid residues, Cren7 contains a flexible seven-residue loop (loop \u03b23\u2013\u03b24) in the region. Here, we report the role of loop \u03b23\u2013\u03b24 in the interaction of Cren7 with duplex DNA. We show that all residues with a large side chain on the loop, i.e., Pro30, Lys31, Arg33 and Lys34, contributed significantly to the binding of Cren7 to DNA. The three basic amino acids affected the ability of Cren7 to constrain negative DNA supercoils in a residue number-dependent manner. The crystal structure of a complex between a mutant Cren7 protein (GR) with loop \u03b23\u2013\u03b24 replaced by two residues (Gly and Arg) to mimic the hinge at the corresponding position in Sul7d and an 8-bp dsDNA has been determined. Structural comparison between the GR\u2013DNA and Cren7\u2013DNA complexes shows that GR resembles Sul7d more than Cren7 in DNA-binding size and in the effect on the width of the major groove of DNA and the pattern of DNA bending.

However, it seems that their roles as key regulators of metabolism have drawn more and more attention in the recent years. Cancer cells display increased metabolic autonomy in comparison to non-transformed cells, taking up nutrients and metabolizing them in pathways that support growth and proliferation. MiRNAs regulate cell metabolic processes through complicated mechanisms, including directly targeting key enzymes or transporters of metabolic processes and regulating transcription factors, oncogenes / tumor suppressors as well as multiple oncogenic signaling pathways. MiRNAs like miR-375, miR-143, miR-14 and miR-29b participate in controlling cancer cell metabolism by regulating the expression of genes whose protein products either directly regulate metabolic machinery or indirectly modulate the expression of metabolic enzymes, serving as master regulators, which will hopefully lead to a new therapeutic strategy for malignant cancer. This review focuses on miRNA regulations of cancer cell metabolism,including glucose uptake, glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle and insulin production, lipid metabolism and amino acid biogenesis, as well as several oncogenic signaling pathways. Furthermore, the challenges of miRNA-based strategies for cancer diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutics have been discussed. \u00a9 2012 Chen et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "pid": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151d0103"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Hongbin Li", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150a9214"}, {"name": "Guoshun Li", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15005a5e"}, {"name": "Xinyu Zhao", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151f0596"}, {"name": "Yongkang Wu", "org": "West China Hospital", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e1520437d"}, {"name": "Wen Ma", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f87f67"}, {"name": "Yuling Liu", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f4e082"}, {"name": "Fengming Gong", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fdd2da"}, {"name": "Shufang Liang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fb3095"}], "title": "Complementary serum proteomic analysis of autoimmune hepatitis in mice and patients", "keywords": ["Autoimmune hepatitis", "Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ)", "Serum proteomics"], "venue": "Journal of Translational Medicine", "year": 2013, "abstract": "Background: Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a chronic liver disease caused by inflammation of the liver. The etiology of AIH remains elusive, and there are no reliable serum biomarkers.Methods: In order to identify candidate biomarkers, 2-DE analysis of serum proteins was performed using a mouse model of AIH induced by treatment with concanavalin A (ConA). To enrich samples for low abundance molecules a commercial albumin removal reagent was used. In an independent analysis, candidate biomarkers were identified in AIH patient's serum by a targeted iTRAQ (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification) identification. Candidates were validated in independent cohorts of ConA treated mice and AIH patients by ELISA (enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay).Results: Nine proteins were differentially expressed in AIH mice treated with con-A. Two of these, the third component of complement (C3) and alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M) were also up-regulated in AIH patient's sera by a targeted iTRAQ identification. In separate validation studies, serum C3 and A2M levels were increased in mice with ConA treatment after 20-40 h and in 34 AIH patients in a subgroup analysis, females with AIH aged 20-50 years old displayed the largest increases in serum A2M level. Biological network analysis implements the complement cascade and protease inhibitors in the pathogenesis of AIH.Conclusion: The serum proteins C3 and A2M are increased both in a mouse model and in patients with AIH by both 2-DE and iTRAQ methods. This integrated serum proteomics investigation should be applicable for translational researchers to study other medical conditions. \u00a9 2013 Li et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "pid": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1509e8cf"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Yueping Yu", "org": "Ningbo Polytechnic", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151a48db"}, {"name": "Guanglin Yu", "org": "Ningbo University", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fc0ced"}, {"name": "Hongbin Li", "org": "Ningbo University", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f7040c"}, {"name": "Guofu Li", "org": "Ningbo University", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e150374da"}], "title": "State monitoring of lathes based on load current signal", "keywords": ["Condition monitoring", "Current signal", "Wavelet denosing", "Wavelet packet transform"], "venue": "Applied Mechanics and Materials", "year": 2012, "abstract": "According to the characteristics of machine tools such as complex driving chain,weak signal and enclosed housing,this paper takes horizontal lathes as study objects and selects current signal which is easy to sample as the analytical signal.We collect motor load current signals of idling, cylindrical cutting and end cutting processing state in the experiment to process the condition monitoring based on wavelet denoising and wavelet packet transform.

The experimental results of nacelle peak accelerations and corresponding dynamic amplification factors show that the joint earthquake and wave action is important for the proper evaluation of structural response. Ignoring the effect of wave action in seismic analysis will lead to underestimation of structural response, especially when the monopile foundation is dynamically sensitive. The coupling of earthquake and wave actions is sourced not only from the relative velocity of vibration but also from the initial condition induced by waves. It has been also derived that the peak acceleration excited by a moderate sea condition is comparable to that by a moderate earthquake.", "pid": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fbbca2"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Zhongjiong Yang", "org": "College of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Central South University", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fab86c"}, {"name": "Hongbin Li", "org": "College of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Central South University", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151cd428"}, {"name": "Liqiang Zhou", "org": "College of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Central South University", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e151388b5"}, {"name": "Yaozhong Lu", "org": "College of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Central South University", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e151657df"}], "title": "Simulation of self-excited vibration behavior of pilot valve core on pilot-operated pressure relief valve with strong vibration", "keywords": ["Dynamic behavior", "Pilot-operated pressure relief valve", "Self-excited vibration", "Simulation", "Tunnel boring machine", "Vibration"], "venue": "Huazhong Keji Daxue Xuebao (Ziran Kexue Ban)/Journal of Huazhong University of Science and Technology (Natural Science Edition)", "year": 2015, "abstract": "As in the tunnel boring machine tunneling process, the cutters, which is on the disc, will cut the hard rock directly, the mathematical model of the pilot-operated pressure relief valve was analyzed, which was used in the hydraulic system, and the dynamics simulation model with strong vibration environment was built.

The simulation result show that, when the system is stable, the pilot valve affected by small interference, the system will attenuate vibration to the stable, but when the interference exceeds the critical value, the system generates periodic oscillation because it enter the domain of attraction of limit cycles, by increasing the spring rate and port diameter of the pilot valve, and reducing half cone angle of pilot valve, the anti-jamming capability of relief can be enhanced.", "pid": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e15054f5a"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Chengzhi He", "org": "Department of Chemistry, University of British Columbia, 2036 Main Mall", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1508cb46"}, {"name": "Chunguang Hu", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Precision Measurements Technology and Instruments, School of Precision Instrument and Optoelectronics Engineering, Tianjin University", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150f1b91"}, {"name": "Xiaodong Hu", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Precision Measurements Technology and Instruments, School of Precision Instrument and Optoelectronics Engineering, Tianjin University", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e15184a07"}, {"name": "Xiaotang Hu", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Precision Measurements Technology and Instruments, School of Precision Instrument and Optoelectronics Engineering, Tianjin University", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e15062544"}, {"name": "Adam Xiao", "org": "Department of Chemistry, University of British Columbia, 2036 Main Mall", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e15108743"}, {"name": "Thomas T.

Here the use of AFM to directly monitor the folding of an \u03b1/\u03b2 protein, NuG2, by using low-drift AFM cantilevers is demonstrated. At slow pulling speeds (<50 nm s<sup>-1</sup>), the refolding of NuG2 can be clearly observed. Lowering the pulling speed reduces the difference between the unfolding and refolding forces, bringing the non-equilibrium unfolding-refolding reactions towards equilibrium. At very low pulling speeds (ca. 2 nm s<sup>-1</sup>), unfolding and refolding were observed to occur in near equilibrium. Based on the Crooks fluctuation theorem, we then measured the equilibrium free energy change between folded and unfolded states of NuG2. The improved long-term stability of AFM achieved using gold-free cantilevers allows folding-unfolding reactions of \u03b1/\u03b2 proteins to be directly monitored near equilibrium, opening the avenue towards probing the folding reactions of other mechanically important \u03b1/\u03b2 and all-\u03b2 elastomeric proteins.", "pid": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150b01f7"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Hongbin Li", "org": "The Division of Rheumatology, Inner Mongolia Medical University", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150eee34"}, {"name": "Roy D.
