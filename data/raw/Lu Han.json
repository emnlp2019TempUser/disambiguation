However, these studies yielded different results. To quantify the association between statin use and risk of lung cancer, we performed a detailed meta-analysis. A literature search was carried out using MEDLINE, EMBASE and COCHRANE database between January 1966 and November 2012. Before meta-analysis, between-study heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed using adequate statistical tests. Fixed-effect and random-effect models were used to calculate the pooled relative risks (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Subgroup analyses, sensitivity analysis and cumulative meta-analysis were also performed. A total of 20 (five randomized controlled trials, eight cohorts, and seven case-control) studies contributed to the analysis. Pooled results indicated a non-significant decrease of total lung cancer risk among all statin users (RR = 0.89, 95% CI [0.78, 1.02]). Further, long-term statin use did not significantly decrease the risk of total lung cancer (RR = 0.80, 95% CI [0.39, 1.64]). In our subgroup analyses, the results were not substantially affected by study design, participant ethnicity, or confounder adjustment. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis confirmed the stability of results. The findings of this meta-analysis suggested that there was no significant association between statin use and risk of lung cancer. More studies, especially randomized controlled trials and high quality cohort studies are warranted to confirm this association. \u00a9 2013 Wang et al.", "pid": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15024e42"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Guodong Li", "org": "Industrial Systems Engineering", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150a7247"}, {"name": "Liming Dai", "org": "Industrial Systems Engineering", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f6fa58"}, {"name": "Lu Han", "org": "Industrial Systems Engineering", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e15197790"}], "title": "Period analysis based on cnn and periodicdity ratio method", "venue": "ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition, Proceedings (IMECE)", "year": 2010, "abstract": "In this work, we use a new approach to test whether the data from a numerical solution of a nonlinear differential system are periodic. If so, we can further check the corresponding period. A cellular neural/nonlinear network (CNN) has been used to test the data from the phase trajectory of the system. Then the period can be found from the data by examining the prime sub periodicity of the system. It is more efficient than using a periodicity with a normal number. The calculated velocity is only 10% of a normal number. To disclose the periodic character of a given nonlinear differential system whose analytical solution is difficult to be obtained, it's very important to test the period of its numerical solution. A method is proposed to test the Periodic ratio method and times period of the data. \u00a9 2013 ASME.", "pid": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15111c49"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Yin-Xia Huang", "org": "State Key Laboratory for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e1509f797"}, {"name": "Jun Han", "org": "State Key Laboratory for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f4d021"}, {"name": "Chen-Fang Dong", "org": "State Key Laboratory for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fb5287"}, {"name": "Li Sun", "org": "State Key Laboratory for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1518880a"}, {"name": "Chen Gao", "org": "State Key Laboratory for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e151fc114"}, {"name": "Xiao-Fan Wang", "org": "State Key Laboratory for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151c2004"}, {"name": "Lu Han", "org": "State Key Laboratory for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f49253"}, {"name": "Wei Zhou", "org": "State Key Laboratory for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1514f5af"}, {"name": "Bao-Yun Zhang", "org": "State Key Laboratory for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e150481bb"}, {"name": "Hui-Ying Jiang", "org": "State Key Laboratory for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1512712f"}, {"name": "Mi-Fang Liang", "org": "State Key Laboratory for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e15133f64"}, {"name": "Xiao-Ping Dong", "org": "State Key Laboratory for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e150151fa"}], "title": "Generation of genetic engineering monoclonal antibodies against prion protein", "keywords": ["Baculovirus expression system", "Monoclonal antibodies", "Phage display", "TSEs"], "venue": "Medical Microbiology and Immunology", "year": 2007, "abstract": "Two strains of Fab monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against prion protein, designated as IV-66 and IV-78, were selected from the phage display libraries.

In this study, the full-length and several truncated human tau proteins were expressed from E. coli and purified. Using GST pull down, co-immunoprecipitation assay and tau-coated ELISA, the molecular interaction between tau protein and PrP was confirmed in the context of the full-length human tau. The N terminus (amino acids 1-91) and tandem repeats region (amino acids 186-283) of tau protein were responsible for the interaction with PrP. The octapeptide repeats within PrP directly affected the binding activity of PrP with tau. GSS-related mutant PrP102L and fCJD- related mutants with two and seven extra octarepeats showed more active binding capacity with tau than wild-type PrP. The molecular interactions between PrP and tau protein highlight a potential role of tau in the biological function of PrP and the pathogenesis of TSE. \u00a9 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Then the kinetic parameters obtained from two experimental systems are extrapolated under the experimental heating rate and the geological heating rate, the results show that the TR (transformation ratio) increasing rate of the gas generation under closed system is slower than that under open system, the reason is that the coal sample pyrolysis to gas under open system is mainly primary cracking, but under closed system it is a common result of primary and secondary cracking. For further application, the hydrocarbon generation threshold is calculated, which combined the burial-thermal history of Xujiaweizi and the kinetic parameters obtained from two experimental systems.

The present study aimed to identify differentially expressed anther proteins and to reveal their possible roles in pollen development and male sterility. To address this question, the proteomes of the wild-type (WT) and YX-1 mutant were compared. Approximately 1760 protein spots on two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) gels were detected. A number of proteins whose accumulation levels were altered in YX-1 compared with WT were identified by mass spectrometry and the NCBInr and Viridiplantae EST databases. Proteins down-regulated in YX-1 anthers include ascorbate peroxidase (APX), putative glutamine synthetase (GS), ATP synthase subunits, chalcone synthase (CHS), CHS-like, putative callose synthase catalytic subunit, cysteine protease, 5B protein, enoyl-ACP reductase, 14-3-3 protein and basic transcription factor 3 (BTF3). Meanwhile, activities of APX and GS, RNA expression levels of apx and atp synthase beta subunit were low in YX-1 anthers which correlated with the expression of male sterility. In addition, several carbohydrate metabolism-related and photosynthesis-related enzymes were also present at lower levels in the mutant anthers. In contrast, 26S proteasome regulatory subunits, cysteine protease inhibitor, putative S-phase Kinase association Protein 1(SKP1), and aspartic protease, were expressed at higher levels in YX-1 anthers relative to WT anthers. Regulation of wolfberry pollen development involves a complex network of differentially expressed genes.

Methods: Four methods based on silica particles and silica-based spin columns (A: Modified Silica Particles Method; B: Geneclean Method; C: QIAamp Mothod; D: Modified QIAquick Method) were respectively used to extract mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from 5 ancient sheep dated to 4000 years ago. PCR amplification of mtDNA was performed, and its results were evaluated by agarose gel electrophoresis. The effects of 4 kinds of methods mentioned above were determined by examining amplification success rates of DNA from 5 ancient sheep. Results: The amplification success rates of 4 methods were different from 20% to 100%, and the effects of extraction based on silica-based spin columns (60%, 100%) were distinctly better than those based on silica particles (20%, 40%). The effect of extraction based on modified silica particles was the worst, and based on modified QIAquick was the best among 4 methods. Conclusion: Modified QIAquick Method is a highly effective method, with a 100% success rate, in which Centricon\u00ae ultrafiltration devices are used to concentrate teeth digest solution and purify DNA through silica-based spin columns.

Experiments showed that the ordered two-dimensional and three-dimensional mesoporous matrices were superior in performance to the non-ordered WTiO matrix. The dramatic enhancement of signal sensitivity by the ordered mesoporous matrices can be reasonably attributed to the ordered structure, which facilitated the understanding on structure-function relationship in mesoporous cavity for laser desorption process of adsorbed biomolecules. With the ordered mesoporous matrix, the short peptides are successfully detected. The presence of trace alkali metal salt effectively increased the analyte ion yields and the MALDI-TOFMS using the inorganic mesoporous matrices displayed a high salt tolerance.

To investigate the origin of Chinese domestic horses, we analyzed mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from 35 horse remains, aged between 4000 and 2000 years, excavated from nine archaeological sites in northern China. The Chinese ancient horses exhibited high matrilineal diversity, falling into all the seven haplogroups (A-G) observed in modern horses. These results suggest that several maternal lines were introduced into the gene pool of Chinese horses in the past. Haplogroups A and F were more prevalent in ancient horses than the other haplogroups. Interestingly, only haplogroups A and F were present in the samples older than 4000 years, while the more recent horses (between 2000 and 3000 years BP) fell into all seven haplogroups. Comparison with DNA data of present-day horses suggests that haplogroup F is like to be an ancient haplogroup of East Asian origin. These analyses also suggest that the origin of Chinese domestic horses is complex, and external mtDNA input occurred after initial domestication. Our results indicate that the Chinese ancient horses are more related to the modern Mongolian horses. Lastly, our results cannot support the previous hypothesis that early Chinese domestic horses were derived from the Przewalski horse. \u00a9 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we analyzed the 289-bp fragment of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region from 14 Chinese ancient goats excavated from two archaeological sites in Inner Mongolia, China dating back about 2500 years. 10 haplotypes were successfully obtained from the 14 ancient goats. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the multiple maternal origins of Chinese domestic goats, three mtDNA lineages A, B, and D were identified in the Chinese ancient individuals, in which lineage A was predominant (70%), lineages B was moderate (20%), and lineage D was present at low frequency (10%). The network analysis showed that lineage B was subdivided into two subgroups B1 and B2. One of the Chinese ancient goats shared the founder haplotype in the center of subgroup B1, and the shared sequences of the founder haplotypes of subgroups B1 and B2 distributed mainly in China. These results implied that lineage B including subgroups B1 and B2 probably originated from China, and further supported the hypothesis that China may be one of the goat domestication centers. In addition, the analysis of shared sequences indicated that the ancient goats from Inner Mongolia were closely genetically related to Chinese modern goats, suggesting that the ancient goats from Inner Mongolia had the genetic contribution to Chinese modern goats. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Two lineages (A and B) were observed in ancient Chinese sheep, of which lineage A was predominant reaching a frequency of 95.5%. Furthermore, phylogenetic network showed that the most frequent haplotype in ancient sheep was the founder of lineage A. These results suggest that Lineage A may hold the key to understanding the origin of Chinese domestic sheep. Sequence sharing and principal component analysis showed that the ancient Chinese sheep had a close affinity to modern Chinese sheep. However, there was no significant breed structure among three modern Chinese sheep groups, making it difficult to determine their relationship to ancient Chinese sheep.

How to analyze the software trustworthiness is an important problem which, in software engineering domain, has not been researched much yet. Consider all the reasons above, this paper presents an analysis method based on rules for software trustworthiness. And it mainly focused on the trustworthiness of software component and lifecycle process. The analyzing process is controlled by trustworthy resource extraction rules, analyzing rules and synthesis rules. This paper also presents a simple formalization tool, which based on communication sequence process, to describe the software. The process of software trustworthy analyzing adapts this method is more flexible and effective. And it could fit the application environment and requirement flexibility.

In order to highlight the distinctions among angles between different data, and enhance the complementary information of angles compared with distance, we propose a new type of image angle measurement in a shifted image space that centered at the data mean. Both angle and distance are fused using the parallel fusion strategy, based on which we propose the complex locality preserving projections (CLPP) to extract low dimensional features that can better preserve the manifold structure of input data set. In order to remove redundant information among features, we further extend CLPP to the orthogonal complex locality preserving projections (OCLPP) approach, which produces orthogonal basis functions.

The resultant polyplexes exhibited similar particle size (135-170nm) and zeta potential (30-35mV). Their distinct binding affinities for siRNA were evaluated by gel retardation, heparin displacement, and invitro siRNA release assays. GTC polyplexes with weak polymer-siRNA binding were structurally unstable and highly susceptible to nuclease degradation, resulting in poor cellular uptake. However, strong binding affinity for siRNA was correlated to delayed intracellular dissociation of polyplexes. The polyplexes with optimized binding affinity for siRNA provided enough protection of siRNA prior to releasing it efficiently in the cytoplasm, resulting in efficient and persistent gene knockdown invitro. Furthermore, they had remarkable antitumor efficacy invivo with regard to the tumor growth retardation, gene knockdown, angiogenesis inhibition, and apoptosis induction in QGY-7703 tumor bearing mice. Therefore, tailoring of the binding strength between the polymeric vector and its siRNA cargo in polyplexes may serve as a feasible tool for improving their therapeutic efficacy. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.", "pid": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e15103e48"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Wei-Hong Zhu", "org": "Lithospheric Centre", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fddb7d"}, {"name": "Rui Gao", "org": "Lithospheric Centre", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fd736b"}, {"name": "Ye Guan", "org": "Lithospheric Centre", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1509cbb5"}, {"name": "Lu Han", "org": "Lithospheric Centre", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e150704ae"}], "title": "Applications of the GIS component and TeeChart control in the overlay treatment of earth sciences", "keywords": ["2D profile", "3D simulation", "GIS component", "Overlay treatment", "TeeChart control"], "venue": "Geological Bulletin of China", "year": 2008, "abstract": "Target-oriented component GIS technology is the main trend of the present GIS development.

However, compared with protein-coding genes and microRNAs, there is a paucity of computational methods and bioinformatic resource platform for understanding the associations between lncRNA and EF. In this study, we developed a novel computational method to identify potential associations between lncRNA and EF, and released LncEnvironmentDB, a user-friendly web-based database aiming to provide a comprehensive resource platform for lncRNA and EF. Topological analysis of EF-related networks revealed the small world, scale-free and modularity structure. We also found that lncRNA and EF significantly enriched interacting miRNAs are functionally more related by analyzing their related diseases, implying that the predicted lncRNA signature of EF can reflect the functional characteristics to some degree. Finally, we developed a random walk with a restart-based computational model (RWREFD) to predict potential disease-related EFs by integrating lncRNA-EF associations and EF-disease associations. The performance of RWREFD was evaluated by experimentally verified EF-disease associations based on leave-one-out cross-validation and achieved an AUC value of 0.71, which is higher than randomization test, indicating that the RWREFD method has a reliable and high accuracy of prediction.

The results of a Taylor power method test and Iwao's - Mathematc expression - regression model also verified that both P. euphratica and P. pruinosa populations belong to a clumped pattern. Although the distribution pattern of P. pruinosa population at different development stages all belonged to a clumped distribution pattern, the aggregation intensity dropped gradually along with age development. The distribution patterns of the P. euphratica population at different development stages changed from random type to clumped type, and further to random type. The differences in spatial distribution patterns of different populations at different development stages were related not only to ecological and biological characteristics of each species in the communities in the light of competitive exclusion principle among the populations, but were also closely related to the habitats in which the species lived in. \u00a9 2008 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH.", "pid": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15015ec1"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Hai-Zhen Wang", "org": "College of Plants Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150a6934"}, {"name": "Lu Han", "org": "College of Plants Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f88ad8"}, {"name": "Zhi-Jun Li", "org": "College of Plants Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15121e54"}, {"name": "Jie Peng", "org": "Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1512558c"}, {"name": "Chun-Hui Ma", "org": "Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fc8e6f"}], "title": "The Photosynthetic and water physiological characteristics of populus euphratica and Populus pruinosa in the upper reaches of Tarim River", "keywords": ["Gas exchange", "Populus euphratica", "Populus pruinosa", "Water potential", "Water use efficiency"], "venue": "Shengtai Xuebao/ Acta Ecologica Sinica", "year": 2009, "abstract": "Populus euphratica Oliv. and Populus pruinosa Schrenk. distributed widely in the upper reaches of Tarim River, China.

The largest and most typical desert riparian forest is found along the Tarim River Basin and occupies over 350000 km2. This forest plays an active role in climatic regulation, desert expansion control, river banks protection, channels stabilization and oasis conservation. The riparian forest not only protects the fragile desert ecological system but also acts as an irreplaceable natural barrier. The Tarim River riparian forest is highly prized in the Tarim Basin for its great ecological, economical and social benefits. As a consequence of the increase in human population, an excessive exploitation of soil and water resources in upper and middle reaches of the Tarim River, induced recession, nonbearing trees and death of a large area of the desert riparian forest beginning with the 1960s. These effects directly endangered projects for development of sustainable oasis agriculture and for maintenance of an ecological balance. The objective of this study was to elucidate the characteristics of gaps in the riparian forest, the disturbance regimes and causal factors of gaps and predict a developmental trend as a theoretical base to manage and realistically protect the desert riparian forest. The P. euphratica forests of the Nature Reserve Region of Luntai County in the middle reaches of Tarim River, is the only remaining original desert forest and the center zone of distribution for P. euphratica. The research plots were located in Luntai (84\u00b015'E, 41 \u00b009'N). The expanded gaps and canopy gaps were investigated in a 0. 64hm2 plot in 2009, by identifying all gap makers and gap border trees and measuring their stems. The results show that gaps in the desert riparian forest were nearly elliptical in horizontal shape, and the average ratio of long axis to short axis for each gap was about 1. 52 for expanded gaps (EG) and 2. 31 for canopy gaps (CG). Gap density was approx 62. 5 per hectare, and the area occupied by EG and CG in desert riparian forest landscape was 69. 52% and 29.03%, respectively. The results also show that the natural disturbance frequency was 1. 45%/a for EGand 0. 61%/a for CG, and the return interval of canopy gaps was about 164 years. For most EG and CG, whose size were in the range of 40 200m2, and 0 80m2, respectively. The gaps were formed within the last 50 years, most of them being 20 to 30 years old, and their formation rate was about 1. 30 gap hm-2 a-1. Most gaps were created by a combination of stem breakage and natural death (95. 73% of total gaps). The majority of gaps consisted of 2 to 5 gap makers with the 4 gap makers category being the most abundant group and the average number of gap makers was 4. 1 per gap. The diameter at breast height (DBH) of most gap makers ranged from 5 to 25cm, and their height varied from 4 to 8m. The average area of EG and CG formed by each gap maker was 27. 12m2 and 11. 32m2, respectively. The structure of DBH classes of the gap border trees (GBT) show a normal distribution, but tree height classes show a left-skewed distribution. The average numbers of GBTs was 8. 375 per gap. The average DBH of GBT was 73. 1% higher than that of gap makers, indicating the gap disturbance was a frequent occurrence in the desert riparian forest, and the continuously declining level of underground water was the driving force of gap formation.", "pid": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ff9100"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Lu Han", "org": "College of Resources and Environmental Sciences", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f88ad8"}, {"name": "Linqiao Xi", "org": "College of Animal Science", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e15178245"}, {"name": "Jiaqiang Wang", "org": "College of Plant Science", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150ec765"}, {"name": "Haizhen Wang", "org": "College of Plant Science", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150a6934"}, {"name": "Zhenrong Yu", "org": "College of Resources and Environmental Sciences", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1508b3a8"}], "title": "Life history characteristics and spatial distribution of Populus pruinosa population at the upper reaches of Tarim River", "keywords": ["Life history", "Population structure", "Populus pruinosa schrenk", "Spatial distribution", "The upper reaches of Tarim River"], "venue": "Shengtai Xuebao/ Acta Ecologica Sinica", "year": 2013, "abstract": "Populus pruinosa Schrenk, a rare and vulnerable plant in arid deserts occurring mainly in the Tarim River Basin, is a key species of the Tarim desert ecosystem.

Desert riparian forest dominated by Populus euphratica has not only protected the fragile desert ecological system but also served as an irreplaceable natural barrier. P. euphratica is highly prized in the Tarim Basin, Xinjiang Region, China, for its great ecological, economic and social benefits. Land opening campaigns resulted in the destruction of large areas of P. euphratica forests after the 1950s. The excessive use of water for irrigation created a severe threat to the remaining P. euphratica forests by robbing them of their source of water. Maintaining the stability of P. euphratica populations is important to local development. The objective of this study was to illuminate the current population structure, quantitative dynamics, forest health and the trends for development of the remaining P. euphratica forests, with the goal of ensuring the wise use (conservation) and protection (preservation) of the dominant forest tree population in the Tarim River Basin. Plots that covered 8.5 hm2 were established in three (upper, middle and lower) sections in the upper reaches of the Tarim River; diameter at breast height (DBH), tree height, crown width and canopy density were measured for stems of all trees with a (DBH) > 2.5 cm, and trees were classified and identified to species using transect sampling. Graphs of the age structure and survival curves were created, and analysis was conducted of the quantitative population dynamics. Time sequence prediction of future forest conditions was conducted based on field data. The results showed that population density of P. euphratica tended to decrease as the size class increased; that is, the value of self-thinning was close to-3/2 and the population density would remain relatively stable when the DBH exceeded 24 cm. The age structure of P. euphratica populations had a positive pyramidal type, with a high percentage of younger age-class individuals. At the middle and lower sections, the survivorship curve of P. euphratica populations conformed to Deevey C type (concave-type) with the dynamic indices (V", "pid": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151c46a7"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Yu Yang", "org": "Graduate University", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150f2457"}, {"name": "Xiaolong Zhou", "org": "China Pharmaceutical University", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150b0988"}, {"name": "Fan Lin", "org": "Graduate University", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15017666"}, {"name": "Baosheng Ge", "org": "Graduate University", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fee113"}, {"name": "Tingjian Wang", "org": "Institute of Oceanology", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fbf556"}, {"name": "Lu Han", "org": "Graduate University", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e15078e77"}, {"name": "Changgui Dou", "org": "China Pharmaceutical University", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150ee21c"}, {"name": "Song Qin", "org": "Institute of Oceanology", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1507576e"}], "title": "High cell density fermentation and leukogenic effect of a new recombinant allophycocyanin (HAPC)", "keywords": ["HAPC", "High cell density fermentation", "Leukogenic effect", "Purification"], "venue": "Gaojishu Tongxin/Chinese High Technology Letters", "year": 2005, "abstract": "A new 6 \u00d7 His\u00b7tag recombinant allophycocyanin HAPC was efficiently expressed in E. coli strain JM109.

WRKY proteins specifically bind to W-boxes, which are found in the promoters of many genes involved in defense and response to environmental stress. TcWRKY53 contains a 975-bp open reading frame encoding a putative protein of 324 amino acids. Homology searches showed that TcWRKY53 resembles similar WRKY domain-containing proteins from rice, parsley and tobacco, especially AtWRKY53 from Arabidopsis thaliana. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR showed that the expression of TcWRKY53 was strongly induced by various environmental stresses, including an excess of NaCl, drought, cold and the signal molecule salicylic acid (SA). The expression of TcWRKY53 in response to NaCl, drought and cold suggested a possible role of TcWRKY53 in abiotic stress response. However, physiological tests indicated that the expression of TcWRKY53 in tobaccos decreases tolerance to sorbitol during seedling root development. This was consistent with PEG6000 treatment of tobacco seedlings, and together these results indicate a negative modulation of TcWRKY53 in response to osmotic stress. Furthermore, two ethylene responsive factor (ERF) family genes, NtERF5 and NtEREBP-1, were negatively induced in TcWRKY53-overexpressing transgenic plants. In contrast, a LEA family gene, NtLEA5, showed no change, suggesting that TcWRKY53 might regulate the plant osmotic stress response by interacting with an ERF-type transcription factor rather than by regulating function genes directly. \u00a9 2008 Springer-Verlag.", "pid": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150e3f85"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Jin Xu", "org": "Department of Biology", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e1500bc7d"}, {"name": "Yuxiu Zhang", "org": "Department of Biological Engineering", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151a4112"}, {"name": "Ziqiu Guan", "org": "Department of Biology", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150f74bc"}, {"name": "Wei Wei", "org": "Department of Biology", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150e249f"}, {"name": "Lu Han", "org": "Department of Biology", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e15078e77"}, {"name": "Tuanyao Chai", "org": "Department of Biology", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150c38c5"}], "title": "Expression and function of two dehydrins under environmental stresses in Brassica juncea L.", "keywords": ["Abiotic stress", "Brassica juncea", "Dehydrin", "Transgenic tobacco", "Yeast"], "venue": "Molecular Breeding", "year": 2008, "abstract": "Dehydrins are capable of conferring abiotic stress tolerance in plants.

Based on the optimal concentration of growth regulators, the shoot cluster regeneration system via callus phase provided the basis of the genetic transformation in T. caerulescens. The key variables in transformation were examined, such as co-cultivation period and bacterial suspension density. Optimizing factors for T-DNA delivery resulted in kanamycin-resistant transgenic shoots with transformation efficiency more than 20%, proven by histochemical GUS assay and PCR analysis. Southern analysis of nptII and RT-PCR of catalase gene demonstrated that the foreign genes were integrated in the genome of transformed plantlets. Moreover, the activity of catalase enzyme in transgenic plants was obviously higher than in wild-type plants.

Detection of green fluorescence from green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the root tip of transgenic tobacco further revealed that BjCET2::GFP is localized at the plasma membrane.

Various technologies have been explored for dechlorination of trichloroethylene. Among the many technologies tested so far, nanometals/bimetals appear to be one of the most promising technologies. In order to further study dechlorination of trichloroethylene, graphite-supported nanoscale Fe-Cu bimetallic particles were synthesized by the aqueous-phase reductive method. The role of graphite-supported was to disperse the nanomaterial, preventing its agglomeration. Under the experimental conditions the effects of the synthesis method and Fe-Cu ratio on the dechlorination rate were investigated. The dechlorination efficiency of TCE by a two-step deposition method was better than synchronous synthesis. Increasing the mass ratio of Cu:Fe to 4wt%, a complete dechlorination was achieved less than 6 hours. There was no obvious difference in dechlorination efficiency of TCE between supported and un-supported nanoscale Fe-Cu bimetallic particles. One day later, dechlorination efficiency of un-supported nanoscale bimetallic particles decreased more compared with supported material; therefore, supported material was a good choice.", "pid": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e151087cd"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Aiyong Zhang", "org": "Key Laboratory of Pollution Processes and Environmental Criteria of Ministry of Education", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e15055f83"}, {"name": "Minghua Zhou", "org": "Key Laboratory of Pollution Processes and Environmental Criteria of Ministry of Education", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150eea24"}, {"name": "Lu Han", "org": "Key Laboratory of Pollution Processes and Environmental Criteria of Ministry of Education", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f78df8"}, {"name": "Qixing Zhou", "org": "Key Laboratory of Terrestrial Ecological Process", "id": "5b5433e3e1cd8e4e15f48c91"}], "title": "Combined potential of three catalysis types on TiO2 nanotube (TNT)/Ti and nanoparticle (TNP)/Ti photoelectrodes: A comparative study", "keywords": ["Azo dye", "Combined degradation", "Electrocatalysis", "Photocatalysis", "TiO2 nanoparticle (TNP)", "TiO2 nanotube (TNT)"], "venue": "Applied Catalysis A: General", "year": 2010, "abstract": "The one-dimensional TiO", "pid": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1518e4b0"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Aiyong Zhang", "org": "Key Lab. of Pollution Processes and Environmental Criteria of Ministry of Education", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e15055f83"}, {"name": "Minghua Zhou", "org": "Key Lab. of Pollution Processes and Environmental Criteria of Ministry of Education", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150eea24"}, {"name": "Lu Han", "org": "Key Lab. of Pollution Processes and Environmental Criteria of Ministry of Education", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f78df8"}, {"name": "Qixing Zhou", "org": "Key Laboratory of Terrestrial Ecological Process", "id": "5b5433e3e1cd8e4e15f48c91"}], "title": "Amperometric Determination of Chemical Oxygen Demand via the Functional Combination of Three Digestion Types", "keywords": ["Bulk-phase COD (PeCOD-bulk)", "Chemical oxygen demand (COD)", "Combined COD (PeCOD-combined)", "Determination principle", "Environmental monitoring", "Thin-film COD (PeCOD-thin)"], "venue": "Electroanalysis", "year": 2010, "abstract": "The study focused on the proposal and experimental validation of an combined photoelectrocatalytic principle for chemical oxygen demand determination (combined PeCOD, PeCOD-combined), which was functionally comprised of photon-efficient thin-film photochemical, photocarrier-efficient electrochemical and conventional bulk-phase photochemical digestion types in one single photodigestion process.

HLTF promotes the Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) that is required for maintaining genomic stability. Here, we identified the deubiquitylating enzyme ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7) as a novel regulator of HLTF stability. We found that USP7 interacted with and stabilized HLTF after genotoxic stress. Furthermore, USP7 mediated deubiquitination significantly prolonged the half-life of HLTF, which in turn increased PCNA polyubiquitination. More intriguingly, silencing of USP7 rendered A549 cells highly sensitive to DNA damage and over-expression of HLTF attenuated this sensitivity. Thus, our results delineate a previously unknown USP7-HLTF-PCNA molecular network controlling DNA damage response. \u00a9 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "pid": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1512996d"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Shaohua Liu", "org": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e1500aa6a"}, {"name": "Haiping Jia", "org": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f90651"}, {"name": "Lu Han", "org": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e15200ef8"}, {"name": "Jiulin Wang", "org": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fceca1"}, {"name": "Pengfei Gao", "org": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151ef62a"}, {"name": "Dongdong Xu", "org": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151c2127"}, {"name": "Jun Yang", "org": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1504857f"}, {"name": "Shunai Che", "org": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f72221"}], "title": "Nanosheet-constructed porous TiO 2-B for advanced lithium ion batteries", "keywords": ["anode materials", "lithium ion batteries", "nanosheets", "porous structures", "TiO 2-B"], "venue": "Advanced Materials", "year": 2012, "abstract": "Hierarchical porous TiO ", "pid": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e15184e1f"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Ben Liu", "org": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f60dc1"}, {"name": "Lu Han", "org": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e15200ef8"}, {"name": "Shunai Che", "org": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f72221"}], "title": "Formation of enantiomeric impeller-like helical architectures by DNA self-assembly and silica mineralization", "keywords": ["chirality", "DNA condensation", "helix reversal", "self-assembly", "silica mineralization"], "venue": "Angewandte Chemie - International Edition", "year": 2012, "abstract": "Impeller-like helical DNA-silica complexes (see picture; green: silica) were synthesized in the presence of magnesium ions (a).

The combination of X-ray diffraction patterns, scanning electron microscopy images, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy images provided visible evidence for the mesostructural constructions of the 2D-square symmetry that transformed from the 2D-hexagonal symmetry.

Replication of non-equilibrium mesophases into porous silica structures allows the characterization of surfactant phases under a variety of chemical and physical perturbations, through methods not typically accessible to liquid crystal chemists. A poignant example is the use of electron microscopy and crystallography, as discussed herein, for the purpose of determining the fundamental role of amphiphile curvature, namely mean curvature and Gaussian curvature, which have been extensively studied in various fields such as polymer, liquid crystal, biological membrane, etc. The present work aims to highlight some current studies devoted to the interface curvature on SMCs, in which electron microscopy and electron crystallography (EC) are used to understand the geometry of silica wall surface in bicontinuous and cage-type mesostructures through the investigation of electrostatic potential maps. Additionally, we show that by altering the synthesis conditions during the preparation of SMCs, it is possible to isolate particles during micellar mesophase transformations in the cubic bicontinuous system, allowing us to view and study epitaxial relations under the specific synthesis conditions. By studying the relationship between mesoporous structure, interface curvature and micellar mesophases using electron microscopy and EC, we hope to bring new insights into the formation mechanism of these unique materials but also contribute a new way of understanding periodic liquid crystal systems. \u00a9 2012 The Royal Society.", "pid": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1508b474"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Ben Liu", "org": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, State Key Laboratory of Composite Materials", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f60dc1"}, {"name": "Lu Han", "org": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, State Key Laboratory of Composite Materials", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e15200ef8"}, {"name": "Shunai Che", "org": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, State Key Laboratory of Composite Materials", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f72221"}], "title": "Formation of impeller-like helical DNA-silica complexes by polyamines induced chiral packing", "keywords": ["Biomolecule", "Chirality", "DNA-silica complex", "Helical architecture", "Liquid crystal", "Polyamine", "Self-assemble"], "venue": "Interface Focus", "year": 2012, "abstract": "The helicity of DNA and its long-range chiral packing are widespread phenomena; however, the packing mechanism remains poorly understood both in vivo and in vitro.

Chiral mesoporous silica (CMS) and helical ribbons can be formed via the chiral packing of the surfactant.

This review is addressed to researchers and students interested in diverse areas of chemistry, particularly inorganic, physical, supramolecular and materials chemistry (63 references). \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.", "pid": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f6e2b3"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Zheng Liu", "org": "National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST)", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ff7a64"}, {"name": "Nobuhisa Fujita", "org": "Institute of Multidisciplinary Research for Advanced Materials", "id": "5b5433e3e1cd8e4e15f4079b"}, {"name": "Keiichi Miyasaka", "org": "Graduate School of EEWS (WCU)", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1511fb5b"}, {"name": "Lu Han", "org": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Technology", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e15200ef8"}, {"name": "Sam M.

For the case of silica mesoporous crystals, new approaches that have been developed recently to determine the three-dimensionally periodic average structure, e.g., through self-consistent analysis of electron microscope images or through consideration of accidental extinctions, are presented. Various structural deviations in nanoporous materials from their average structures including intergrowth, surface termination, incommensurate modulation, quasicrystal and defects are demonstrated. Ibidem observations of the scanning electron microscope and atomic force microscope give information about the zeolite-crystal-growth mechanism, and an energy for unstitching a building-unit from a crystal surface is directly observed by an anatomic force microscope. It is argued how these observations lead to a deeper understanding of the materials. \u00a9 The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press [on behalf of The Japanese Society of Microscopy].

However, it is difficult to characterize the structure of for example MOFs via X-ray powder diffraction because of the serious overlapping of reflections caused by their large unit cells, and it is also difficult to directly observe the opening of surface pores using ordinary methods.

Although many chiral inorganic powders have been successfully synthesised, the artificial synthesis of chiral inorganic films is rare. Herein, we reported a facile synthetic route for the growth of monolayered chiral film on the quaternary ammonium-modified silicon substrate. The films grew on the substrate surface because of the strong electrostatic interaction between positively charged quaternary ammonium groups and negatively charged phosphate groups of DNA, with subsequent growth to right-handed, vertically aligned, impeller-like helical architectures with left-handed two-dimensional square p4mm-structured DNA chiral packing. The DNA-silica composite films exhibited strong optical activity at 295 nm and in the range of 400-800 nm, corresponding to DNA chiral packing (absorption) and to the helical blade in the impeller (scattering), respectively. Upon removal of DNA templates, the pure inorganic impeller-like helical morphology was maintained; consequently, the scattering-based optical response was blue-shifted approximately 200 nm as a result of a decrease in the effective average refractive index.

The advantages are easy fabrication, easy integration, and also the potential to realizing active plasmonic devices. In this talk, we will present our recent work in this field. Polymer (PMMA) nano-structures are fabricated on a silver film by the electron beam lithography (EBL) and laser interference lithography. These nano-structures are used to manipulate the behaviors of the SPs, such as converging, diverging, and guiding the propagation of SPs in subwavelength scale. Except for the pure PMMA nano-structures, dye materials (Rhodamine B, RhB) doped PMMA structures are also fabricated on the silver film. The RhB molecules will work as the active medium to excite the SPs or compensation the loss of SPs wave. The dye doped PMMA nanostructure provides a choice to realize active plasmonic elements, such as SPs Bragg gratings. On the other hand, the interaction between the fluorescence molecules and SPs will give rise to some new optical phenomena, such as directional fluorescence emission, anisotropic fluorescence emission.

The influence of the Ag NCs' concentration and detection ability of the substrate are also investigated. \u00a9 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.", "pid": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ff2aa3"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Yikai Chen", "org": "Institute of Photonics, Department of Optics and Optical Engineering, University of Science and Technology of China", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e1500073b"}, {"name": "Douguo Zhang", "org": "Institute of Photonics, Department of Optics and Optical Engineering, University of Science and Technology of China", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151ca9f1"}, {"name": "Lu Han", "org": "Institute of Photonics, Department of Optics and Optical Engineering, University of Science and Technology of China", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e15074d95"}, {"name": "Xiangxian Wang", "org": "Institute of Photonics, Department of Optics and Optical Engineering, University of Science and Technology of China", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e1519d161"}, {"name": "Liangfu Zhu", "org": "Institute of Photonics, Department of Optics and Optical Engineering, University of Science and Technology of China", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1512460f"}, {"name": "Pei Wang", "org": "Institute of Photonics, Department of Optics and Optical Engineering, University of Science and Technology of China", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151a641d"}, {"name": "Hai Ming", "org": "Institute of Photonics, Department of Optics and Optical Engineering, University of Science and Technology of China", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151cc986"}], "title": "Dark-field imaging by active polymer slab waveguide", "venue": "Applied Optics", "year": 2013, "abstract": "A dark-field imaging technique taking advantage of the active polymer slab waveguide (APSW) is experimentally investigated. The dye molecules (Rhodamine 6G, Rh6G) are doped in the polymer film for the launching of surface waves on the APSW, such as the surface plasmon polaritons on the Ag-polymer-air interface, evanescent fields at the polymer-air interface by the total internal reflection, or the guided modes. The localized surface waves will not radiate into the far-field space directly. When the specimens are placed on the surface of the APSW, these surface waves will be scattered to the far-field region, which forms the dark-field image of the specimen. Experimental results show that usage of APSW leads to high-contrast dark-field images with the conventional optical microscope system. The polymer film involved in the proposed dark-field microscopy brings about the merits of reduced roughness, good stability, bio-compatibility, and shorter wavelength of the illumination light source. \u00a9 2013 Optical Society of America.", "pid": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151b7394"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Dong Qiu", "org": "Institute of Photonics, Department of Optics and Optical Engineering, University of Science and Technology of China", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150ebbf0"}, {"name": "Douguo Zhang", "org": "Institute of Photonics, Department of Optics and Optical Engineering, University of Science and Technology of China", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151ca9f1"}, {"name": "Yikai Chen", "org": "Institute of Photonics, Department of Optics and Optical Engineering, University of Science and Technology of China", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e1500073b"}, {"name": "Liangfu Zhu", "org": "Institute of Photonics, Department of Optics and Optical Engineering, University of Science and Technology of China", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1512460f"}, {"name": "Lu Han", "org": "Institute of Photonics, Department of Optics and Optical Engineering, University of Science and Technology of China", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e15074d95"}, {"name": "Pei Wang", "org": "Institute of Photonics, Department of Optics and Optical Engineering, University of Science and Technology of China", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15ff154d"}, {"name": "Hai Ming", "org": "Institute of Photonics, Department of Optics and Optical Engineering, University of Science and Technology of China", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151cc986"}, {"name": "Ramachandram Badugu", "org": "Center for Fluorescence Spectroscopy, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Maryland School of Medicine", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e151556a5"}, {"name": "Joseph R.

With the aid of a high-refractive-index prism or an oil-immersion objective, the SPCE or BSWCE can be coupled into free space. But the large volumes of the prism and objective are certainly unfavorable for miniaturization of the optical systems or inconvenient for applications such as the optical displays. Here we experimentally demonstrate a new method to extract the SPCE or BSWCE with a subsurface dielectric grating. The experimental results verify that the chip-like substrate with two decorated sides can bring out the directional fluorescence emission in free space. The emitting direction and emitting patterns can be tuned by the period size and dimensionality of the gratings. Our work provides a new strategy to realize free-space directional fluorescence emission at a very low cost and compact configuration, which has potential applications in fluorescence-based sensing, imaging, light-emitting diodes, optical displays, and other near-field optical devices. \u00a9 2014 Optical Society of America.", "pid": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151d4806"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Jiatong Li", "org": "School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1511c38d"}, {"name": "Baojun Zhao", "org": "School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f4a935"}, {"name": "Linbo Tang", "org": "School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e15161581"}, {"name": "Chenwei Deng", "org": "School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1516f5ab"}, {"name": "Lu Han", "org": "School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e15074d95"}, {"name": "Jinghui Wu", "org": "School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fe8593"}], "title": "WLSD: A perceptual stimulus model based shape descriptor", "keywords": ["Feature selection", "Multi-scale representation", "Shape descriptor", "Shape retrieval"], "venue": "KSII Transactions on Internet and Information Systems", "year": 2014, "abstract": "Motivated by the Weber\u2019s Law, this paper proposes an efficient and robust shape descriptor based on the perceptual stimulus model, called Weber\u2019s Law Shape Descriptor (WLSD).

Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were di-rectly reduced and stabilized by chitosan (CS), forming a positively charged AuNP-CS core. Charge-reversible PAH-Cit and polyethylenimine (PEI) were sequentially deposited onto the surface of AuNP-CS through electrostatic interaction, forming a PEI/PAH-Cit/AuNP-CS shell/core structure. After loading siRNA, the cytotoxicity of siRNA/PEI/PAH-Cit/AuNP-CS against HeLa and MCF-7R cells was negligible. This vehicle completely protected siRNA against enzymatic degradation at vector/RNA mass ratios of 2.5:1 and above. An in vitro release profile demonstrated an efficient siRNA release (79%) from siRNA/PEI/PAH-Cit/AuNP-CS at pH 5.5, suggesting a pH-induced charge-reversing action of PAH-Cit. This mechanism also worked in vivo and facilitated the escape of siRNA from endosomes. Using this carrier, the uptake of cy5-siRNA by HeLa cells was significantly increased compared to PEI, an efficient polycationic transfection reagent. In drug-resistant MCF-7 cells, specific gene silencing effectively reduced expression of MDR1, the gene encoding the drug exporter P-gp, and consequently promoted the uptake of doxorubicin.

Western blotting and caspase activation studies revealed that EGFP. p53/PEI/PAH-Cit/AuNP-CS complexes may induce PC-3 apoptosis via the mitochondria-mediated signaling pathway by up-regulation of Bax, down-regulation of Bcl-2, and activation of caspase-3. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd.", "pid": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e150613d3"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Anil Kumar", "org": "Beijing Institute of Nanoenergy and Nanosystems, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fda259"}, {"name": "Shuaidong Huo", "org": "CAS Key Laboratory for Biomedical Effects of Nanomaterials and Nanosafety, National Center for Nanoscience and Technology", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151baa9e"}, {"name": "Xu Zhang", "org": "CAS Key Laboratory for Biomedical Effects of Nanomaterials and Nanosafety, National Center for Nanoscience and Technology", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e150002c0"}, {"name": "Juan Liu", "org": "CAS Key Laboratory for Biomedical Effects of Nanomaterials and Nanosafety, National Center for Nanoscience and Technology", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e1520e35a"}, {"name": "Aaron Tan", "org": "Centre for Nanotechnology and Regenerative Medicine, UCL Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London (UCL)", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150d0e84"}, {"name": "Shengliang Li", "org": "CAS Key Laboratory for Biomedical Effects of Nanomaterials and Nanosafety, National Center for Nanoscience and Technology", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e151449d3"}, {"name": "Shubin Jin", "org": "CAS Key Laboratory for Biomedical Effects of Nanomaterials and Nanosafety, National Center for Nanoscience and Technology", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e15173d36"}, {"name": "Xiangdong Xue", "org": "CAS Key Laboratory for Biomedical Effects of Nanomaterials and Nanosafety, National Center for Nanoscience and Technology", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f605dc"}, {"name": "Yuanyuan Zhao", "org": "CAS Key Laboratory for Biomedical Effects of Nanomaterials and Nanosafety, National Center for Nanoscience and Technology", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e1501049b"}, {"name": "Tianjiao Ji", "org": "CAS Key Laboratory for Biomedical Effects of Nanomaterials and Nanosafety, National Center for Nanoscience and Technology", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1504d517"}, {"name": "Lu Han", "org": "CAS Key Laboratory for Biomedical Effects of Nanomaterials and Nanosafety, National Center for Nanoscience and Technology", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150a43b7"}, {"name": "Hong Liu", "org": "Beijing Institute of Nanoenergy and Nanosystems, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e151626f5"}, {"name": "Xiaoning Zhang", "org": "Department of Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University", "id": "5b5433e3e1cd8e4e15f4258a"}, {"name": "Jinchao Zhang", "org": "College of Chemistry and Environmental Science, Chemical Biology Key Laboratory of Hebei Province, Hebei University", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150c1951"}, {"name": "Guozhang Zou", "org": "CAS Key Laboratory for Biomedical Effects of Nanomaterials and Nanosafety, National Center for Nanoscience and Technology", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15022206"}, {"name": "Tianyou Wang", "org": "Capital Institute of Pediatrics", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1512e6e0"}, {"name": "Suoqin Tang", "org": "Department of Pediatrics, General Hospital of People's Liberation Army", "id": "5b5433e3e1cd8e4e15f47500"}, {"name": "Xing-Jie Liang", "org": "CAS Key Laboratory for Biomedical Effects of Nanomaterials and Nanosafety, National Center for Nanoscience and Technology", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e1500fa15"}], "title": "Neuropilin-1-targeted gold nanoparticles enhance therapeutic efficacy of platinum(IV) drug for prostate cancer treatment", "keywords": ["glutathione-stabilized gold NPs (Au@GSH)", "neuropilin-1 (Nrp-1) receptor", "NF-\u03baB mechanism", "platinum(IV) drug complex", "targeted drug delivery systems (TDDSs)"], "venue": "ACS Nano", "year": 2014, "abstract": "Platinum-based anticancer drugs such as cisplatin, oxaliplatin, and carboplatin are some of the most potent chemotherapeutic agents but have limited applications due to severe dose-limiting side effects and a tendency for cancer cells to rapidly develop resistance. The therapeutic index can be improved through use of nanocarrier systems to target cancer cells efficiently. We developed a unique strategy to deliver a platinum(IV) drug to prostate cancer cells by constructing glutathione-stabilized (Au@GSH) gold nanoparticles. Glutathione (GSH) has well-known antioxidant properties, which lead to cancer regression. Here, we exploit the advantages of both the antioxidant properties and high surface-Area-to-volume ratio of Au@GSH NPs to demonstrate their potential for delivery of a platinum(IV) drug by targeting the neuropilin-1 receptor (Nrp-1). A lethal dose of a platinum(IV) drug functionalized with the Nrp-1-targeting peptide (CRGDK) was delivered specifically to prostate cancer cells in vitro. Targeted peptide ensures specific binding to the Nrp-1 receptor, leading to enhanced cellular uptake level and cell toxicity. The nanocarriers were themselves nontoxic, but exhibited high cytotoxicity and increased efficacy when functionalized with the targeting peptide and drug. The uptake of drug-loaded nanocarriers is dependent on the interaction with Nrp-1 in cell lines expressing high (PC-3) and low (DU-145) levels of Nrp-1, as confirmed through inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and confocal microscopy. The nanocarriers have effective anticancer activity, through upregulation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-\u03baB) protein (p50 and p65) expression and activation of NF-\u03baB-DNA-binding activity. Our preliminary investigations with platinum(IV)-functionalized gold nanoparticles along with a targeting peptide hold significant promise for future cancer treatment. \u00a9 2014 American Chemical Society.", "pid": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151c1fde"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Lu Han", "org": "Beijing Engineering Research Center of Printed Electronics, Beijing Institute of Graphic Communication", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150a43b7"}, {"name": "Yu-Xia Zhao", "org": "Beijing Engineering Research Center of Printed Electronics, Beijing Institute of Graphic Communication", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151a80fa"}, {"name": "Cheng-Mei Liu", "org": "Beijing Engineering Research Center of Printed Electronics, Beijing Institute of Graphic Communication", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1505ab2c"}, {"name": "Lu-Hai Li", "org": "Beijing Engineering Research Center of Printed Electronics, Beijing Institute of Graphic Communication", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e15093ad5"}, {"name": "Xing-Jie Liang", "org": "CAS Key Laboratory for Biomedical Effects of Nanomaterials and Nanosafety, National Center for Nanoscience and Technology", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e1500fa15"}, {"name": "Yen Wei", "org": "Department of Chemistry, Key Laboratory of Bioorganic Phosphorus Chemistry and Chemical Biology (Ministry of Education), Tsinghua University", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f52562"}], "title": "The effects of nanoparticle shape on electrical conductivity of Ag nanomaterials", "venue": "Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Electronics", "year": 2014, "abstract": "Silver nanomaterials have a wide application in printed electronics due to their excellent electrical conductivity.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the quantitative trends and quality indicators of RCTs published in mainland China over a recent 10-year period. Methods: We individually searched all 17 available pediatric journals published in China from January 1, 2002 to December 30, 2011 to identify RCTs of drug treatment in participants under the age of 18 years. The quality was evaluated according to the Cochrane quality assessment protocol. Results:Of 1287 journal issues containing 44398 articles, a total of 2.4% (1077/44398) articles were included in the analysis. The proportion of RCTs increased from 0.28% in 2002 to 0.32% in 2011. Individual sample sizes ranged from 10 to 905 participants (median 81 participants); 2.3% of the RCTs were multiple center trials; 63.9% evaluated Western medicine, 32.5% evaluated traditional Chinese medicine; 15% used an adequate method of random sequence generation; and 10.4% used a quasi-random method for randomization. Only 1% of the RCTs reported adequate allocation concealment and 0.6% reported the method of blinding. The follow-up period was from 7 days to 96 months, with a median of 7.5 months. There was incomplete outcome data reported in 8.3%, of which 4.5% (4/89) used intention-to-treat analysis. Only 0.4% of the included trials used adequate random sequence allocation, concealment and blinding. The articles published from 2007 to 2011 revealed an improvement in the randomization method compared with articles published from 2002 to 2006 (from 2.7% to 23.6%, p = 0.000). Conclusions: In mainland China, the quantity of RCTs did not increase in the pediatric population, and the general quality was relatively poor. Quality improvements were suboptimal in the later 5 years. \u00a9 2013 Yang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "pid": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1505857e"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Hong Huang", "org": "Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children (Sichuan University), Ministry of Education", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1512590f"}, {"name": "Lu Han", "org": "Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children (Sichuan University), Ministry of Education", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e15169f0f"}, {"name": "Yu-Mei Lan", "org": "Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children (Sichuan University), Ministry of Education", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1512315f"}, {"name": "Ling-Li Zhang", "org": "Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children (Sichuan University), Ministry of Education", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1502ba9b"}], "title": "One-pot synthesis of a 3,6-branched hexaarabinogalactan using galactopyranosyl thioglycoside diol as a key glycosylating agent", "keywords": ["Arabinogalactan", "One-pot glycosylation", "Regioselective glycosylation", "Synthesis"], "venue": "Journal of Asian Natural Products Research", "year": 2014, "abstract": "We present in this paper the efficient four-component one-pot synthesis of a fully protected hexaarabinogalactan 2 with di-branched structure by using D-thiogalactopyranoside 3,6-diol 3 as the central glycosylating agent.

It can be found that the transition routes from periodicity to chaos can be more divergent than other routes from periodicity to quasi-periodicity. Therefore, some predications can be made about the occurrence of the chaos by observing the divergence or convergence of the transition routes. Further more, the new symmetrical transition characters from periodicity to quasi-periodicity can be displayed in terms of the periodicity Ratio.

Twenty-four hours after CLP, the animals were sacrificed, and spleens were harvested for evaluation. Apoptosis was detected by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) analysis. The expressions of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting. Results: High degree of lymphocyte apoptosis was observed in the CLP group. Meanwhile, marked induction of GRP78 expression was observed in the splenocytes in septic mice, indicating the motivation of the unfolded protein responses (UPR). Furthermore, both mRNA and protein levels of CHOP were highly upregulated in the CLP group, suggesting that ER stress response was switched to a pro-apoptotic response.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate salivary gland functional recovery after sialendoscopic management of obstructive salivary gland disease. Study Design: A prospective, self-control study. Methods: The present study was undertaken among patients scheduled for sialendoscopic surgery with unilateral salivary ductal obstructions. Glandular function was quantitatively assessed with the use of sialometry and scintigraphy preoperatively and at least 3 months postoperatively. Results: A consecutive series of 17 patients were followed for 14 \u00b1 8 months. Sialendoscopic procedures included removal of calculi in 15 cases and dilatation of stenosis in two cases. All patients were free of symptoms during follow-up. Before surgery, there was a significant decline in the resting and stimulated saliva flow rate, uptake index, and excretion fraction of the obstructive glands compared with the contralateral normal glands. Postoperatively, although the degrees of functional recovery varied in individuals, statistical analysis revealed that the glandular function increased significantly in the affected glands and had no differences when compared to the contralateral glands. Conclusions: These data provide a unique functional assessment after sialendoscopic surgery. Our results demonstrate that sialendoscopy is an organpreserving surgical approach which can achieve satisfactory functional recovery in the management of salivary ductal obstructions. \u00a9 2009 The American Laryngological, Rhinological and Otological Society, Inc.", "pid": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1502b631"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Qun He", "org": "Center for Disease Prevention and Control of Guangdong Province", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e15193156"}, {"name": "Xiaorong Wang", "org": "Department of Community and Family Medicine", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150cd057"}, {"name": "Yinghua Xia", "org": "Faculty of Medical Statistics and Epidemiology", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ffc2ed"}, {"name": "Jeffrey S.

Their migration process and work conditions may influence their health and work ability. The work ability of migrant workers in China and the influence of the migration process on work ability have not been explored extensively in previous studies. The objective of this study is to evaluate the association of migration characteristics and work-related factors with work ability among migrant workers in the Pearl River Delta. Methods. In this cross-sectional survey, the study population consisted of 907 migrant workers from ten factories in the Pearl River Delta who were exposed to organic solvents during work. The primary dependent variable of the study was work ability, measured by the Work Ability Index (WAI). The independent variables were individual characteristics, migration characteristics, and work-related factors. Logistic regression models were used to determine the influence of different factors on work ability and three dimensions of WAI. Results: The result shows that among migration characteristics, social support was significantly associated with all three dimensions of the work ability index. Permanent migration intention and longer length of migration were negatively associated with the mental resource dimension of WAI. WAI was also influenced by individual and work-related factors. Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest that expanding migrants' social networks and social support systems in their work place or living community, (i.e. expanding the functions of labor unions) would be an effective way to improve migrant workers' work ability. Improving of migrant workers' physical and psychosocial related work environments would also increase their work ability. \u00a9 2014 Han et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "pid": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1512ac94"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Ping Zhu", "org": "Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Guangzhou Red Cross Hospital, Medical College of Jinan University", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f606d5"}, {"name": "Yan Liu", "org": "Department of Nephrology, Guangzhou Red Cross Hospital, Medical College of Jinan University", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f55da5"}, {"name": "Lu Han", "org": "Department of Medical Statistics and Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen University", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15122001"}, {"name": "Gang Xu", "org": "Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Guangzhou Red Cross Hospital, Medical College of Jinan University", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e15076006"}, {"name": "Jian-Min Ran", "org": "Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Guangzhou Red Cross Hospital, Medical College of Jinan University", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15124304"}], "title": "Serum uric acid is associated with incident chronic kidney disease in middle-aged populations: A meta-analysis of 15 cohort studies", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "year": 2014, "abstract": "Background: Mounting evidence indicates that elevated serum uric acid may increase the incidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Its close relative alfalfa (Medicago sativa) is the most widely grown forage legume crop in the United States. By screening a large population of M. truncatula mutants tagged with the transposable element of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) cell type1 (Tnt1), we identified a mutant line (NF2089) that maintained green leaves and showed green anthers, central carpels, mature pods, and seeds during senescence. Genetic and molecular analyses revealed that the mutation was caused by Tnt1 insertion in a STAY-GREEN (MtSGR) gene. Transcript profiling analysis of the mutant showed that loss of the MtSGR function affected the expression of a large number of genes involved in different biological processes. Further analyses revealed that SGR is implicated in nodule development and senescence. MtSGR expression was detected across all nodule developmental zones and was higher in the senescence zone. The number of young nodules on the mutant roots was higher than in the wild type. Expression levels of several nodule senescence markers were reduced in the sgr mutant. Based on the MtSGR sequence, an alfalfa SGR gene (MsSGR) was cloned, and transgenic alfalfa lines were produced by RNA interference. Silencing of MsSGR led to the production of stay-green transgenic alfalfa. This beneficial trait offers the opportunity to produce premium alfalfa hay with a more greenish appearance. In addition, most of the transgenic alfalfa lines retained more than 50% of chlorophylls during senescence and had increased crude protein content.

The expression domain of KNOXI is regulated by ASYMMETRIC LEAVES1/ROUGHSHEATH2/PHANTASTICA (ARP) genes, which are associated with leaf morphology. In the inverted repeat-lacking clade (IRLC) of Fabaceae, the orthologs of LEAFY (LFY) function in place of KNOXI to regulate compound leaf development. Here, we characterized loss-of-function mutants of ARP (PHAN) and SHOOTMERISTEMLESS (STM)- and BREVIPEDICELLUS (BP)-like KNOXI in the model IRLC legume species Medicago truncatula. The function of ARP genes is species specific. The repression of STM/BP-like KNOXI genes in leaves is not mediated by PHAN, and no suppression of PHAN by STM/BP-like KNOXI genes was observed either, indicating that STM/BP-like KNOXI genes are uncoupled from PHAN in M. truncatula. Furthermore, comparative analyses of phenotypic output in response to ectopic expression of KNOXI and the M. truncatula LFY ortholog, SINGLE LEAFLET1 (SGL1), reveal that KNOXI and SGL1 regulate parallel pathways in leaf development. We propose that SGL1 probably functions in a stage-specific manner in the regulation of the indeterminate state of developing leaves in M. truncatula. \u00a9 2014 American Society of Plant Biologists.

In many plants, source pressure results from thermodynamically active loading in which energy is used to transfer sucrose (Suc) from mesophyll cells to the phloem of leaf minor veins against a concentration gradient. However, in some species, almost all trees, correlative evidence suggests that sugar migrates passively through plasmodesmata from mesophyll cells into the sieve elements. The possibility of alternate loading mechanisms has important ramifications for the regulation of phloem transport and source-sink interactions. Here, we provide experimental evidence that, in gray poplar (Populus tremula \u00d7 Populus alba), Suc enters the phloem through plasmodesmata. Transgenic plants were generated with yeast invertase in the cell walls to prevent Suc loading by this route. The constructs were driven either by the constitutive 35S promoter or the minor vein-specific galactinol synthase promoter. Transgenic plants grew at the same rate as the wild type without symptoms of loading inhibition, such as accumulation of carbohydrates or leaf chlorosis. Rates of photosynthesis were normal. In contrast, alfalfa (Medicago sativa) plants, which have limited numbers of plasmodesmata between mesophyll and phloem, displayed typical symptoms of loading inhibition when transformed with the same DNA constructs. The results are consistent with passive loading of Suc through plasmodesmata in poplar. We also noted defense-related symptoms in leaves of transgenic poplar when the plants were abruptly exposed to excessively high temperatures, adding to evidence that hexose is involved in triggering the hypersensitive response.", "pid": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150a6bea"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Dan-Feng Xiao", "org": "Daqing Oilfield Corp.", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150e0c86"}, {"name": "Lu Han", "org": "Daqing Oilfield Corp.", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f819db"}, {"name": "Jian-Guo Sun", "org": "Daqing Oilfield Corp.", "id": "5b5433e3e1cd8e4e15f3f988"}, {"name": "Ming-Hui Zhang", "org": "Daqing Oilfield Corp.", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151b70a4"}, {"name": "Yan Wang", "org": "Daqing Oilfield Corp.", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15029db7"}], "title": "Application of polymer gelling fracturing fluid in low permeability reservoir in Daqing Oilfield", "keywords": ["Acidic medium", "Daqing oilfields", "Formulations", "Low damage", "Low permeability oil reservoirs", "Reservoir fracturing", "Synthetic polymer gelling fracturing fluid", "Titanic crosslinker", "Water soluble hydrophobically associating polymer"], "venue": "Oilfield Chemistry", "year": 2009, "abstract": "In the polymer gelling fracturing fluid (PGFF) presented, the thickener was polymer WF924 of M = 6 \u00d7 10", "pid": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fbbebb"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Hongbo Chen", "org": "College of Horticulture", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e151779ea"}, {"name": "Tianlai Li", "org": "College of Horticulture", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e15039e28"}, {"name": "Zhouping Sun", "org": "College of Horticulture", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f7d918"}, {"name": "Wuhong Wang", "org": "Institute of Vegetables", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150e89d3"}, {"name": "Lu Han", "org": "College of Horticulture", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15010bd6"}], "title": "Effect of matrix-aeration-cultivation on water, gas and fertilizer in artificial nutrition matrix", "keywords": ["Gas environment in matrix", "Matrix enzyme activity", "Matrix-aeration-cultivation", "Water and fertilizer in matrix"], "venue": "Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering", "year": 2009, "abstract": "In order to improve rhizoshpere environment in cucumber Cucumis sativus), aeration cultivation of artificial nutrition matrix (Z1) was compared with traditional cultivation of sandy loam (T1) and traditional cultivation of artificial nutrition matrix (CK), and changes in matrix enzyme activities, matrix nutrition contents and matrix physical characteristics were investigated in the experiment.

Methods and Materials: Between August 2003 and December 2006, 323 patients with NPC were treated with IMRT according to this institutional protocol. Presenting stages were Stage II in 63, Stage III in 166, and Stage IVA/B in 94 patients. High-risk CTV encompassed gross tumor volume and entire nasopharyngeal mucosa with a margin. A reduced CTV was delineated for the remaining subclinical regions adjacent to the primary disease. Uninvolved neck nodes were delineated according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) / European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) consensus excluding the deep jugular (i.e., lymph nodes in retrostyloid space above C1 vertebra) and submental nodes. Patients with locoregionally advanced diseases also received cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Results: With a median follow-up of 30 months (range, 4-53months), 12, 6, and 26 patients had developed local, regional, and distant failures, respectively. The 3-year estimated local control, regional control, metastasis-free survival, disease-free survival and overall survival were 95%, 98%, 90%, 85%, and 90%, respectively. Multivariate analyses revealed that T-classification had no predictive value for outcome, whereas N-classification was significant for predicting metastasis-free (p = 0.005) and overall survival (p =0.006). Ten patients (7.8%) experienced Grade II xerostomia at 24 months after treatment. No Grade III or IV late-toxicities were observed. Two patients died of treatment-induced complications. Conclusion: The IMRT approach using a reduced target volume provided favorable outcome for NPC with acceptable toxicity. This strategy needs to be optimized and then tested in a prospective setting to learn whether further improvement can be achieved. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Presenting stages were stage IIB in 62, stage III in 197, and stage IVA/B in 111 patients. All patients except for 36 patients with cervical lymphadenopathy of 4 cm or less in diameter received 2 cycles of cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Forty-eight patients received cisplatin-based concurrent chemotherapy as well.Results: With a median follow-up time of 31 months (range 5 to 61 months), the 3-year local control, regional control, metastasis-free survival (MFS), disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 95%, 97%, 86%, 81% and 89%, respectively. Multivariate analyses revealed that both age (\u2264 60 vs. >60) and N-classification are significant prognosticators for OS (P = 0.001, hazard ratio [HR] 2.395, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.432-4.003; P = 0.012, hazard ratio [HR] 2.614, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.235-5.533); And N-classification is the only significant predicative factor for MFS (P = 0.002, [HR] 1.99, 95% CI 1.279-3.098). T-classification and concurrent chemotherapy were not significant prognostic factors for local/regional control, MFS, DFS, or OS. Subgroup analysis revealed that concurrent chemotherapy provided no significant benefit to IMRT in locoregionally advanced NPC, but was responsible for higher rates of grade 3 or 4 acute toxicities (50% vs. 29.8%, P < 0.005).

Methods: Between August 2003 and December 2006, 107 patients with T1N1M0 (8%), T2N0M0 (13%), or T2N1M0 (79%) NPC were definitively treated with IMRT. Sixty-one received IMRT only, and 46 patients had various strategies of systemic treatment, consisting of abbreviated neoadjuvant (38 patients), concurrent (8 patients), or adjuvant (16 patients) chemotherapy. Radiation doses prescribed to the planning tumor volume of the gross disease, high-risk clinical tumor volume, and low-risk clinical tumor volume were 66 to 70 Gy, 54 to 60 Gy, and 50-54 Gy, respectively.

The current study set out to discuss the clinical significance of LMP-1 on the screening of NPC. Methods: Three hundred patients who visited our institution (Department of Radiation Oncology, Fujian Provincial Cancer Hospital, Fuzhou, China) with ENT symptoms between 2007 and 2008 were involved in this study, and all of them were agreed to be involved in this investigation. Not only did they undergo nasopharyngeal swab to obtain cells for the LMP-1 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, but also nasopharyngeal biopsy were taken to identify the diagnosis. Results: An amount of DNA that was sufficient for PCR was extracted from 243 (81%) swab samples, the positive rate of LMP-1 of those with non-nasopharyngeal carcinoma was 3.85% (4/108), which was much lower than those with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (P < 0.05).

Conclusion: The nasopharyngeal swab coupled with PCR-based EBV LMP-1 detection have high sensitivity and specificity, and also good repeatability, it could serve as part of the screening program for high-risk populations. \u00a9 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.", "pid": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150d9ddd"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Lu Han", "org": "Department of Radiation Oncology", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f92d35"}, {"name": "Shao-Jun Lin", "org": "Department of Radiation Oncology", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15025989"}, {"name": "Jian-Ji Pan", "org": "Department of Radiation Oncology", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151de69b"}, {"name": "Chuan-Ben Chen", "org": "Department of Radiation Oncology", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ffc6db"}, {"name": "Yu Zhang", "org": "Department of Radiation Oncology", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1501c908"}, {"name": "Xiu-Chun Zhang", "org": "Department of Radiation Oncology", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15111b6a"}, {"name": "Xi-Yi Liao", "org": "Department of Radiation Oncology", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f7365a"}, {"name": "Qi-Song Chen", "org": "Department of Radiation Oncology", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e15141cce"}], "title": "Prognostic factors of 305 nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy", "keywords": ["Intensity-modulated", "Nasopharyngeal neoplasm", "Prognosis", "Radiotherapy", "Side effect"], "venue": "Chinese Journal of Cancer", "year": 2010, "abstract": "Background and Objective: Radiotherapy is effective in treating nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). This study evaluated the treatment efficacy, toxicity, and prognostic factors of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in the treatment NPC. Methods: Between September 2003 and September 2006, 305 patients with NPC were treated with IMRT in Fujian Provincial Cancer Hospital. IMRT was delivered as follows: gross tumor volume (GTV) received 66.0-69.8 Gy In 30-33 fractions, high-risk clinical target volume (GTV-1) received 60.0-66.65 Gy, low-risk clinical target volume (GTV-2) and clinical target volume of cervical lymph node regions (CTV-N) received 54.0-55.8 Gy. Patients with stages III or IV disease also received cisplatin-based chemotherapy. All patients were assessed for local-regional control, survival, and toxicity. Results: With a median follow-up of 35 months (range, 5-61 months), there were 16, 8, and 39 patients who had developed local, regional, and distant recurrence, respectively. The 3-year rates of local control, regional control, metastasis-free survival, disease-free survival, and overall survival were 94.3%, 97.7%, 86.1%, 80.3%, and 89.1%, respectively. Multivariate analyses revealed that T-classification had no predictive value for local control and survival, whereas N-classification was a significant prognostic factor for overall survival (P < 0.001), metastasis-free survival (P < 0.001), and disease-free survival (P = 0.003). For stages III-IV disease, concurrent and adjuvant chemotherapy did not influence prognosis. The most severe acute toxicities included Grade III mucositis in 14 patients (4.6%), Grade III skin desquamation in 90 (29.5%), and Grades III-IV leucocytopenia in 20 (6.5%). There were 7% patients with Grade II xerostomia after 2 years of IMRT, no Grades 3 or 4 xerostomia was detected. Conclusions: IMRT provided favorable locoregional control and survival rates for patients with NPC, even in those with locally advanced disease. The acute and late toxicities were acceptable. N-classification was the main factor of prognosis.

METHODS: One hundred and five consecutive patients with pathologically confirmed NPC with distant metastasis at diagnosis seen between 1995 and 2002 were reviewed. All were offered cisplatin-based chemotherapy, high-dose RT (>30 Gy) to the head and neck region, and active treatment to the metastatic foci. RESULTS: Patients' median age was 46 years, and all had a Karnofsky Performance Score of \u226570. Eighty-nine patients (85%) had metastases confined to 1 organ. Ninety-six patients (91%) received at least 1 cycle of chemotherapy and 71 (68%) received greater than 65 Gy of radiation to the head and neck region. With a median follow-up time of 22 months (range: 2 to 142 mo), 90 patients had deceased, and the median survival time of the entire group was 25 months. The 2 and 5-year estimated overall survival rates were 50% and 17%, respectively. Radiation dose of greater than 65 Gy to the primary region (P = 0.05) and number of organs with metastases (single vs. multiple) (P = 0.002) were independent predictive factors for overall survival on log-rank tests. Only moderately severe acute toxicities, such as Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grade 3 mucositis, skin desquamation, and leukocytopenia were observed. No patient experienced grade 4 acute toxicities. CONCLUSIONS: High-dose RT is indicated for local disease control in patients with metastatic NPC, and may improve survival when actively used with systemic chemotherapy and local treatment for metastatic foci. Patients with single-organ metastases have a better prognosis as compared with those with more widespread metastases.

Ten of the 20 patients were treated by the IMRT-7P plan, which was planned by the hind half-planes of seven fields of the IMRT plan. The remaining 10 patients were treated by the IMRT-7A plan, which was planned by seven equi-spaced fields of the IMRT plan. Then, the plans of homologous hind half-plane and equi-spaced fields were re-planned.

Methods and materials Between November 2003 and May 2007, 414 patients with non-metastatic NPC were treated with IMRT according to our institutional protocol. Treatment outcomes at 5 years were analyzed. Distances from GTV-T to CTV2 (i.e., CTV 59.4 Gy) in 6 directions (anterior, posterior, superior, inferior, and bilateral) were measured and analyzed. Results The 5-year estimated overall survival (OS), disease free survival (DFS), local control (LC) were 80%, 77% and 95%, respectively. For the margins measured from GTV-T to CTV2, margins used with T4 disease were significantly and uniformly smaller than the whole group in all the 6 directions (P = 0.000, 0.000, 0.000, 0.000 and 0.046, respectively). However, no increase of local recurrence was associated to this limited margins used. Conclusions Our 5-years' experience showed a very high LC rate. The strategy we used for CTV delineation was safe and reliable. Determined CTV through GTV expansion to a minimally required margin, using GTV + margin (used in our T4 patients) + the whole nasopharyngeal mucosa, especially for the patients with early T disease, might be feasible. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Moreover, when 25 g/l wheat bran hydrolysate was combined with 30 g/l corn steep liquor, the l-lactic acid fermentation efficiency (yield 0.99 g/g, productivity 3.75 g/l/h) was even higher than that of the control with 15 g/l yeast extract (yield 0.95 g/g, productivity 2.46 g/l/h).

The dysregulation of lncRNA has been implicated in various complex human diseases. Although several computational methods have been developed to predict disease-related lncRNA, this still remains a considerable challenging task. In this study, we tried to construct an lncRNA-lncRNA crosstalk network by examining the significant co-occurrence of shared miRNA response elements on lncRNA transcripts from the competing endogenous RNAs viewpoint. As expected, functional analysis showed that lncRNA sharing significantly enriched interacting miRNAs tend to be involved in similar diseases and have more functionally related flanking gene sets. We further proposed a novel rank-based method, RWRHLD, to prioritize candidate lncRNA-disease associations by integrating three networks (miRNA-associated lncRNA-lncRNA crosstalk network, disease-disease similarity network and known lncRNA-disease association network) into a heterogeneous network and implementing a random walk with restart on this heterogeneous network. We used leave-one-out cross-validation to test the performance of this rank-based method in this study based on known experimentally verified lncRNA-disease associations and obtained a reliable AUC value of 0.871, which is much higher than RWR merely based on an lncRNA network, hypergeometric test and random situation.

In this study, we investigated the effect of SH in membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN) induced by cationic Bovine Serum Albumin (C-BSA) in BALB/c mice. Materials and methods: Mice were divided into four groups, including normal vehicle-treated controls (N group), model (M group), low SH of 60. mg/kg body weight (L group), or high SH of 120. mg/kg body weight (H group). Urine protein quantification was detected by the urine protein strip test. Morphological assessment in kidneys was observed by light microscope and electron microscopy. The level of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB) in the nuclear was evaluated by Western blot. Immunohistochemical was used to analyze the expression of MCP-1. Results: SH was shown to reverse C-BSA induced increases in urinary protein, and changes in morphology. Treatment with SH at 60-120. mg/kg (L and H groups, respectively) dose-dependently decreased the level of nuclear NF-\u03baB and MCP-1 expression compared to that of the M group. Conclusions: This study reveals that SH could treat C-BSA induced MGN in BALB/c mice by suppressing NF-\u03baB activation and MCP-1 expression. Therefore, the most likely mechanism underlying the biological effects of SH is inhibition of an NF-\u03baB mediated-cytokine pathway. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.", "pid": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15023eb6"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Hong-Ming Li", "org": "Medical College and Dental Hospital", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e151850e4"}, {"name": "Xue-Qin Wan", "org": "Medical College and Dental Hospital", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1508c8d9"}, {"name": "Qian Lan", "org": "Medical College and Dental Hospital", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1513999f"}, {"name": "Lu Han", "org": "Medical College and Dental Hospital", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1503e1a0"}, {"name": "Bo Kang", "org": "Medical College and Dental Hospital", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f6a014"}, {"name": "Wei Wei", "org": "Medical College and Dental Hospital", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150a6695"}, {"name": "Gong-Yuan Lei", "org": "Medical College and Dental Hospital", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1503996f"}, {"name": "Jie-Ying Huang", "org": "Medical College and Dental Hospital", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151dcfb2"}], "title": "Guided bone regeneration to prevent wisdom tooth extraction complications in clinical research", "keywords": ["Alveolagiat", "Alveolar resorptions", "Guided bone regeneration", "Impacted teeth"], "venue": "2010 4th International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering, iCBBE 2010", "year": 2010, "abstract": "In order to prevent the occurrence of complications after wisdom tooth extraction, using clinical research methods, choice of mandibular third molar patients in 65 cases, according to teeth were randomly divided into three groups.

The amino acid residue frequency appearing in the antigenic peptides at both the primary sequence and structural level was determined and used to identify \"hot spots\" or antigenically important regions. Unexpectedly, different antigenic structures were seen for different antisera. Moreover, five antigenic regions were identified, of which all but one are located in the conserved HA stem region that is responsible for membrane fusion. Our findings are corroborated by several recent studies on cross-neutralizing H1 subtype antibodies that recognize the HA stem region. The antigenic peptides identified may provide clues for creating peptide vaccines with better accessibility to memory B cells and better induction of cross-neutralizing antibodies than the whole HA protein. The scheme used in this study enables a direct mapping of the antigenic regions of viral proteins recognized by antisera, and may be useful for dissecting the antigenic structures of other viral proteins. \u00a9 2011 Xu et al.", "pid": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e15102189"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Hai Gang Li", "org": "School of Energy and Power Engineering", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1507ea2d"}, {"name": "Jing Ping Si", "org": "School of Energy and Power Engineering", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150e2b2a"}, {"name": "Lu Han", "org": "School of Energy and Power Engineering", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f7ad56"}, {"name": "Bao Wei Zhang", "org": "School of Energy and Power Engineering", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f4a81c"}], "title": "Finite element analysis of heavy-duty dump truck subframe based on ANSYS", "keywords": ["ANSYS finite element analysis", "Dynamic characteristics", "Static characteristics", "Subframe"], "venue": "Advanced Materials Research", "year": 2011, "abstract": "Dump truck subframe is an important bearing components which is used for connecting the chassis frame and the cargo compartment, and the rationality of its design has an extremely important influence on performance of the entire vehicle, moreover, the use of CAE technology can optimize the design of the subframe.

Improving the management level of risk sources for pollution accidents has become an urgent demand for most industrialized countries. In pollution accidents, the released chemicals harm the receptors to some extent depending on their sensitivity or susceptibility. Therefore, identifying the potential risk sources from such a large number of chemical enterprises has become pressingly urgent. Based on the simulation of the whole accident process, a novel and expandable identification method for risk sources causing water pollution accidents is presented. The newly developed approach, by analyzing and stimulating the whole process of a pollution accident between sources and receptors, can be applied to identify risk sources, especially on the nationwide scale. Three major types of losses, such as social, economic and ecological losses, were normalized, analyzed and used for overall consequence modeling. A specific case study area, located in a chemical industry park (CIP) along the Yangtze River in Jiangsu Province, China, was selected to test the potential of the identification method. The results showed that there were four risk sources for pollution accidents in this CIP.

Two lab-scale reactors were operated in parallel to treat synthetic municipal wastewater with continuous operation. The results indicated that both systems had the same high removal efficiency of ammonium, while the IFAS\u2013MBR showed a higher ability to remove COD. The trans-membrane pressure in the MBR was higher than that in the IFAS\u2013MBR during the entire operation, due to a higher total modified fouling index of the mixed liquor and the resultant higher membrane fouling potential. The concentrations of extracellular polymeric substances and soluble microbial products were higher in MBR, despite the functional groups were almost similar in two reactors. The conventional MBR had more small molecular weight components (<1\u00a0kDa) and soluble microbial metabolites. This seems to cause pore blocking, which directly results in membrane flux declining and membrane resistance rising in the MBR system.

Four humification indices (HIXs) deduced from emission spectra (A<inf>4</inf>/A<inf>1</inf>), excitation spectra (I<inf>426</inf>/I<inf>366</inf>), synchronous fluorescence spectra (I<inf>370</inf>/I<inf>330</inf>) and derivative (I<inf>360</inf>/I<inf>320</inf>) were used for the description of composition and humification degree of DOM. Three components (C1\u2013C3) were derived from excitation-emission matrices with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). The results showed that dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations in tributaries water decreased when they flowed through the constructed wetland. The values of A<inf>4</inf>/A<inf>1</inf>, I<inf>426</inf>/I<inf>366</inf>, I<inf>370</inf>/I<inf>330</inf> and I<inf>360</inf>/I<inf>320</inf> suggested that the DOM consisted of organic components with low molecular weight and low aromatic contents in the tributary. I<inf>360</inf>/I<inf>320</inf> could differentiate humification degree more clearly than the other three HIXs. The fluorescence index indicated a more microbially derived composition of DOM in the constructed wetland. The DOM fluorescence was dominated by the tryptophan-like fluorescence material (C3, more than 40\u00a0%), followed by humic-like substance (C1, about 30\u00a0%). Non-humic component (C2, about 20\u00a0%) was the least component. The percentage of C1 declined from upstream to downstream along the wetland, while C3 showed inverse tendency. The proportion of C2 remained relatively constant in all sampling points. Principal component analysis suggested that the humification degree of the DOM in the slowly flowing region was the highest among the wetlands, followed by those from the regions disturbed by tributaries, the sampling sites in mainstream and the outlet zone of wetland. The humification degree also showed a good correlation mainly with TN, TP and Chlorophyll a.

However, little has been done to link EHFs with another important host factor type, i.e., virus targeting proteins (VTPs) that viruses directly interact with for intracellular survival, hampering the integrative understanding of virus-host interactions. Using EHFs and VTPs for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and influenza A virus (IAV) infections, we found in general that despite limited overlap, EHFs and VTPs are both among the most differentially dysregulated genes in host transcriptional response to HIV and IAV infections, and notably they show consistency in regulation orientation. In the human protein-protein interaction network, both EHFs and VTPs hold topologically important positions at the global center, and importantly their direct interactions are statistically significant. We also identified BRCA1 and TP53 (or SMAD3 and PIK3R1) being the most extensive VTP-interacting EHFs (or EHF-interacting VTPs) for HIV-1 and IAV, which hold great potential in deciphering specific infection features and discovery of host directed antivirals. Further, most EHFs are the upstream regulators of VTPs when mapped in the same signaling pathways, some of which present intensive cross links. Collectively, these results provide insights into functional associations of the identified host gene factors for viral infections and highlight the regulatory significance of EHFs, and the necessity of their selective exploitation in confrontation to viral infections.", "pid": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1514eb09"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Lu Han", "org": "Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Neuroimmunopharmacology, Beijing Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fbb5cb"}, {"name": "Haochen He", "org": "Department of Biotechnology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1518f561"}, {"name": "Fei Li", "org": "Department of Biotechnology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150b93bc"}, {"name": "Xiuliang Cui", "org": "International Cooperation Laboratory on Signal Transduction, Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Institute, Second Military Medical University", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15006d2a"}, {"name": "Dafei Xie", "org": "Department of Biotechnology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ff95fa"}, {"name": "Yang Liu", "org": "Department of Biotechnology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e150689ef"}, {"name": "Xiaofei Zheng", "org": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e15168201"}, {"name": "Hui Bai", "org": "Department of Pharmacy, No.451 Hospital of Peoples Liberation Army", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1513bd78"}, {"name": "Shengqi Wang", "org": "Department of Biotechnology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e1500b259"}, {"name": "Xiaochen Bo", "org": "Department of Biotechnology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fca02f"}], "title": "Inferring infection patterns based on a connectivity map of host transcriptional responses", "venue": "Scientific Reports", "year": 2015, "abstract": "Host responses to infections represent an important pathogenicity determiner, and delineation of host responses can elucidate pathogenesis processes and inform the development of anti-infection therapies. Low cost, high throughput, easy quantitation, and rich descriptions have made gene expression profiling generated by DNA microarrays an optimal approach for describing host transcriptional responses (HTRs). However, efforts to characterize the landscape of HTRs to diverse pathogens are far from offering a comprehensive view. Here, we developed an HTR Connectivity Map based on systematic assessment of pairwise similarities of HTRs to 50 clinically important human pathogens using 1353 gene-expression profiles generated from >60 human cells/tissues. These 50 pathogens were further partitioned into eight robust \" HTR communities\" (i.e., groups with more consensus internal HTR similarities). These communities showed enrichment in specific infection attributes and differential gene expression patterns. Using query signatures of HTRs to external pathogens, we demonstrated four distinct modes of HTR associations among different pathogens types/class, and validated the reliability of the HTR community divisions for differentiating and categorizing pathogens from a host-oriented perspective. These findings provide a first-generation HTR Connectivity Map of 50 diverse pathogens, and demonstrate the potential for using annotated HTR community to detect functional associations among infectious pathogens.", "pid": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e150431d7"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Feng Gao", "org": "College of Materials Science and Engineering", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f7b055"}, {"name": "Lu Han", "org": "College of Materials Science and Engineering", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151b333d"}, {"name": "Kaixi Li", "org": "Key Laboratory of Carbon Materials", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e15062e4d"}], "title": "Effects of process parameters and ash on the adsorption properties of activated carbon from coals", "keywords": ["Activated carbon", "Adsorption properties", "Ash", "Process parameters"], "venue": "Journal of the Chemical Society of Pakistan", "year": 2013, "abstract": "Super-activated carbon was prepared from three representative Shanxi coals, i.e. Datong bituminous coal, Yangquan anthracite and Jincheng anthracite by KOH activation.

Merr.) diseases and causes severe yield loss and seed quality deficiency. Multiple studies have proved that a single dominant gene can confer resistance to several SMV strains. Plant introduction (PI) 96983 has been reported to contain SMV resistance genes (e.g., Rsv1 and Rsc14) on chromosome 13. The objective of this study was to delineate the genetics of resistance to SMV in PI 96983 and determine whether one gene can control resistance to more than one Chinese SMV strain. In this study, PI 96983 was identified as resistant and Nannong 1138-2 was identified as susceptible to four SMV strains SC3, SC6, SC7, and SC17. Genetic maps based on 783 F2 individuals from the cross of PI 96983 \u00d7 Nannong 1138-2 showed that the gene(s) conferring resistance to SC3, SC6, and SC17 were between SSR markers BARCSOYSSR_13_1114 and BARCSOYSSR_13_1136, whereas SC7 was between markers BARCSOYSSR_13_1140 and BARCSOYSSR_13_1185. The physical map based on 58 recombinant lines confirmed these results. The resistance gene for SC7 was positioned between BARCSOYSSR_13_1140 and BARCSOYSSR_13_1155, while the resistance gene(s) for SC3, SC6, and SC17 were between BARCSOYSSR_13_1128 and BARCSOYSSR_13_1136. We concluded that, there were two dominant resistance genes flanking Rsv1 or one of them at the reported genomic location of Rsv1. One of them (designated as \"Rsc-pm\") conditions resistance for SC3, SC6, and SC17 and another (designated as \"Rsc-ps\") confers resistance for SC7. The two tightly linked genes identified in this study would be helpful to cloning of resistance genes and breeding of multiple resistances soybean cultivars to SMV through marker-assisted selection (MAS). \u00a9 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.", "pid": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e150576ab"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Jie Zhou", "org": "Department of Applied Mathematics", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150d91fa"}, {"name": "Lu Han", "org": "Department of Applied Mathematics", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e15141f5b"}, {"name": "Sanyang Liu", "org": "Department of Applied Mathematics", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fbc593"}], "title": "Nonlinear mixed-effects state space models with applications to HIV dynamics", "keywords": ["EM algorithm", "HIV dynamics", "Mixed effect", "Nonlinear state space model", "Sequential Monte Carlo"], "venue": "Statistics and Probability Letters", "year": 2013, "abstract": "Nonlinear state space models with mixed-effect (NLMESSM) are proposed to model HIV clinical longitudinal data.

Materials and Methods: Sixty-five patients with breast cancer undergoing operations in the general surgery department were considered as the observation group, and 50 healthy outpatients of our hospital as the control group. Cubital venous blood was drawn in the morning from fasting patients in the two groups and chemiluminescence immunoassays were used to detect the levels of CA15-3, CA125 and CEA in serum. The follow-up duration was from 4 months to 2 years, and change in levels of the indicators was detected by dynamically drawing blood. After surgery, cancer tissue samples of patients in observation group remained on file (the non-recurrent patients were biopsied). Immunohistochemistry was applied to determine the expression of ER, PR and VEGF in tissue. Results: The effective rate of 12 patients with negative ER and PR expression was 33.3% in the observation group, being associated with prognosis to varying extents. Serum CA15-3, CA125 and CEA in the observation group were all significantly higher than in control group (p<0.01). With increase in pathological staging, levels of serum CA15-3, CA125 and CEA gradually increased (p<0.01).

This study aimed to verify the Tokyo guidelines for the management of acute cholangitis and cholecystitis of 2007 edition (TG07) in patients with obstructive cholangitis due to benign and malignant diseases. METHODS: The patients were retrieved from our existing ERCP database. Final diagnosis of acute cholangitis was made by detecting purulent bile during biliary drainage. We examined and compared the guidelines concerning benign and malignant obstruction. RESULTS: In 120 patients in our study, 82 and 38 had benign and malignant biliary obstruction, respectively. Guidelines based diagnosis was made in 68 (82.9%), 36 (94.7%), and 104 (86.7%) patients with benign, malignant, and overall biliary obstruction, respectively, which were significantly higher than 44 (53.7%), 17 (44.7%), and 61 (50.8%) diagnosed by Charcot's triad (P<0.001). Treatment consistent with the guidelines was offered to 58 (70.7%) patients with benign obstruction and 15 (39.5%) patients with malignant obstruction (P=0.001). No significant association was observed between clinical compliance, guidelines-based severity grades and clinical outcomes. In the multivariate model, intrahepatic obstruction (OR=11.2, 95% CI: 1.55-226.9) and hypoalbuminemia (\u226425.0 g/L; OR=17.3, 95% CI: 3.5-313.6) were independent risk factors for a 30-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The TG07 are more reliable than Charcot's triad for the diagnosis of acute cholangitis albeit with limited prognostic values. Intrahepatic obstruction and hypoalbuminemia are new predictors of poor prognosis and need further assessment. \u00a9 2013, Hepatobiliary Pancreat Dis Int.

Methods: The data of 115 patients with MAH who were treated at the Medical Oncology Department of Chinese PLA General Hospital from Jan., 2001 to Dec., 2010 was retrospectively reviewed. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and the Cox proportional hazard model with statistic software SPSS 18.0. Results: The patients had blood calcium levels ranging from 2.77 to 4.87 mmol/L. Except for 9 cases who died or were discharged within 5 days after admission, all other patients recovered to normal blood calcium level after treatment with bisphosphonates or intravenous hydration and diuretics; their survival after occurrence of MAH was from 1 day to 4,051 days, and the median survival time was only 50 days. In the log-rank test, the male, renal metastasis, central nervous system symptoms and hypercalcemia occurring over 140 days after cancer diagnosis were predictors of poor survival (P=0.002, P=0.046, P=0.000, P=0.009). In the COX analysis, being male, central nervous system symptoms and hypercalcemia lasting over 140 days after cancer diagnosis were independent prognostic factors for survival time (RR=2.131, P=0.027; RR=3.054, P=0.002; RR=2.403, P=0.001). According to these factors, a score system was established to predict the patient prognosis and adjust the treatment. Conclusion: Cancer patients with MAH have an extremely poor median survival. Some independent factors indicate poor prognosis, including male gender, central nervous system symptoms and hypercalcemia lasting over 140 days after cancer diagnosis. The prognostic score can serve as a reference for MAH prognosis and treatment, worthy of further investigation.", "pid": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f95d15"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Gang Sun", "org": "Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Chinese PLA General Hospital", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15019019"}, {"name": "Lu Han", "org": "General Oncology Department, Chinese PLA General Hospital", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e15143a8b"}, {"name": "Yunsheng Yang", "org": "Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Chinese PLA General Hospital", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e150862e8"}, {"name": "Enqiang Linghu", "org": "Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Chinese PLA General Hospital", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1501ff71"}, {"name": "Wen Li", "org": "Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Chinese PLA General Hospital", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150d4d72"}, {"name": "Fengchun Cai", "org": "Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Chinese PLA General Hospital", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e1500be22"}, {"name": "Jinyan Kong", "org": "Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Chinese PLA General Hospital", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fad8c4"}, {"name": "Xiangdong Wang", "org": "Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Chinese PLA General Hospital", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f782cf"}, {"name": "Jiangyun Meng", "org": "Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Chinese PLA General Hospital", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ffde07"}, {"name": "Hong Du", "org": "Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Chinese PLA General Hospital", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e15161f78"}, {"name": "Hongbin Wang", "org": "Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Chinese PLA General Hospital", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fde144"}, {"name": "Qiyang Huang", "org": "Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Chinese PLA General Hospital", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e15183c09"}, {"name": "Quratulain Hyder", "org": "Department of Gastroenterology, Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f85a6e"}, {"name": "Xiuli Zhang", "org": "Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Chinese PLA General Hospital", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1511bff1"}], "title": "Comparison of two editions of Tokyo guidelines for the management of acute cholangitis", "keywords": ["Acute cholangitis", "Biliary drainage", "Interrater agreement", "Tokyo guidelines"], "venue": "Journal of Hepato-Biliary-Pancreatic Sciences", "year": 2014, "abstract": "Background The Tokyo guidelines from 2007 (TG07) and 2013 (TG13) were compared for the management of acute cholangitis (AC).

However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms behind the protective effects of TMP on the heart remain to be elucidated. In this study, we aimed to determine the effects of TMP on angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced hypertrophy in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and its possible mechanisms of action. In addition, we investigated whether TMP regulates tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) secretion and expression. We found that TMP significantly inhibited the Ang II-induced hypertrophic growth of neonatal cardiomyocytes, as evidenced by the decrease in [3H]leucine incorporation and \u03b2-myosin heavy chain (\u03b2-MHC) mRNA expression. TMP inhibited Ang II-stimulated TNF-\u03b1 protein secretion and mRNA expression in the cardiomyocytes. Further experiments revealed that Ang II increased the level of the phosphorylated form of the transcription factor, nuclear factor \u039a-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u039aB), as well as NF-\u039aB-DNA binding activity in the cardiomyocytes; treatment with TMP significantly inhibited the Ang II-induced activation of NF-\u039aB. Furthermore, the inhibition of NF-\u039aB by the specific inhibitor, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), markedly attenuated the Ang II-induced increase in [3H]leucine incorporation, \u03b2-MHC mRNA expression and TNF-\u03b1 protein secretion.

Methods: Retrospective analysis of data from the case retrieval system of Qilu Hospital of Shandong University located in Jinan city of Shandong Province was done for patients with acute MI from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2012. Results: Stenting was an important factor affecting older patients' total hospitalization costs (\u03b2=0.685, P=0.000) and treatment costs during the follow-up period (duration of hospital stay only, \u03b2=0.508, P=0.000). Stenting was also a protective factor in the prevention of acute heart failure (HF) in older patients with acute MI during the follow-up period (odds ratio 0.189, 95% confidence interval 0.059-0.602, P=0.005). Implementation of percutaneous coronary intervention reduced the incidence of acute HF in older inpatients with acute MI (27.8% versus 4.3%, P=0.001) and without diabetes (18.2% versus 3.8%, P=0.001). Moreover, among the elderly, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio estimate for implementing percutaneous coronary intervention in diabetic patients was higher than in nondiabetic patients.

From the perspective of reducing the incidence of acute HF in inpatients, implementation of percutaneous coronary intervention after an acute MI is more cost-effective in older patients with diabetes mellitus than in those without it. \u00a9 2014 Fu et al.", "pid": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e151fb629"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Wen-Yuan Ding", "org": "Department of Cardiology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e151602f1"}, {"name": "Lin Liu", "org": "Department of Cardiology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e1519d90b"}, {"name": "Zhi-Hao Wang", "org": "Department of Geriatrics, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150c043d"}, {"name": "Meng-Xiong Tang", "org": "Department of Emergency, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150d0cff"}, {"name": "Yun Ti", "org": "Department of Cardiology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1506bdc1"}, {"name": "Lu Han", "org": "Department of Cardiology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fb0940"}, {"name": "Lei Zhang", "org": "Department of Cardiology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15feed5b"}, {"name": "Yun Zhang", "org": "Department of Cardiology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15009677"}, {"name": "Ming Zhong", "org": "Department of Cardiology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f95e9a"}, {"name": "Wei Zhang", "org": "Department of Cardiology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f4e7de"}], "title": "FP-receptor gene silencing ameliorates myocardial fibrosis and protects from diabetic cardiomyopathy", "keywords": ["Diabetic cardiomyopathy", "FP receptor gene silencing", "Myocardial fibrosis", "Protein kinase C", "Rho kinase"], "venue": "Journal of Molecular Medicine", "year": 2014, "abstract": "Prostaglandin F2", "pid": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15122300"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Guan Qi Fan", "org": "Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Remodeling and Function Research, Chinese Ministry of Education and Chinese Ministry of Public Health, Department of Cardiology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1508b393"}, {"name": "Kai-Li Fu", "org": "Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Remodeling and Function Research, Chinese Ministry of Education and Chinese Ministry of Public Health, Department of Cardiology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1502afa8"}, {"name": "Cheng-Wei Jin", "org": "Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Remodeling and Function Research, Chinese Ministry of Education and Chinese Ministry of Public Health, Department of Cardiology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1502d738"}, {"name": "Xiao-Zhen Wang", "org": "Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15035378"}, {"name": "Lu Han", "org": "Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Remodeling and Function Research, Chinese Ministry of Education and Chinese Ministry of Public Health, Department of Cardiology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fb0940"}, {"name": "Hui Wang", "org": "Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Remodeling and Function Research, Chinese Ministry of Education and Chinese Ministry of Public Health, Department of Cardiology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1503a36a"}, {"name": "Ming Zhong", "org": "Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Remodeling and Function Research, Chinese Ministry of Education and Chinese Ministry of Public Health, Department of Cardiology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f95e9a"}, {"name": "Yun Zhang", "org": "Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Remodeling and Function Research, Chinese Ministry of Education and Chinese Ministry of Public Health, Department of Cardiology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15feaa0f"}, {"name": "Wei Zhang", "org": "Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Remodeling and Function Research, Chinese Ministry of Education and Chinese Ministry of Public Health, Department of Cardiology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1517501b"}, {"name": "Zhi-Hao Wang", "org": "Department of Geriatric Medicine, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151c3719"}], "title": "A medical costs study of older patients with acute myocardial infarction and metabolic syndrome in hospital", "keywords": ["Acute myocardial infarction", "Aging", "Cost- effectiveness", "Metabolic syndrome", "Vascular"], "venue": "Clinical Interventions in Aging", "year": 2015, "abstract": "Background: Older patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) usually have a poor prognosis, but whether this poor prognosis leads to high hospital costs remains unclear. This study investigated the clinical outcomes of and costs incurred by older patients with AMI and metabolic syndrome (MS) in hospital. Methods and results: Patients with AMI seen at Qilu Hospital of Shandong University between January 2011 and May 2013 were separated into four groups: young non-MS patients (n=282), older non-MS patients (n=324), young MS patients (n=217), and older MS patients (n=174). We found that advanced age was significantly associated with worse clinical outcomes, and that the clinical outcomes in patients with AMI and MS are also worsened. At the same cost (RMB\u00a510,000), older patients with and without MS had a markedly increased number of cardiovascular incidences compared with younger patients without MS. In a comparison of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of percutaneous coronary intervention, older patients without MS had a lower ICER for cardiovascular incidences and a higher ICER for cardiac event-free survival rate when compared with young patients without MS, but a lower ICER for cardiovascular incidences and a higher ICER for cardiac event-free survival rate when compared with older MS patients.Conclusion: Older AMI patients have poor clinical outcomes and their treatment is not cost- effective; however, the results are worse in patients with AMI and MS.

Methods: A randomized, double-blind trial was performed with 40 HC subjects who fulfilled the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Patients were given pitavastatin calcium 1 mg/d (Group 1) or 2 mg/d (Group 2) for 8 weeks. There were 20 patients in each group, and 30 gender- and age-matched healthy subjects as controls were recruited. FMD of the brachial artery, carotid IMT, and arterial stiffness indicated by \u03b2 were measured at baseline and at 8 weeks after starting pitavastatin calcium therapy using ultrasound techniques.

Results: At baseline, higher total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), reduced FMD, and increased \u03b2 and IMT were observed in HC patients (P<0.001 for all) compared with controls. After 8 weeks, TC was decreased by 20.59%/27.56% and LDL-C 30.92%/35.64%, respectively, in comparison to baseline groups; the HC groups had reduced \u03b2 and improved endothelial function over the 8-week follow-up (P<0.05\u20130.001); nonetheless, no significant alterations of IMT were found (P>0.05).

The tests were carried out at pilot scale, using a steel tank as flocculation basin. The grids are made of plastic material and the cross section size of the grid trips is 7 mm in width and 2 mm in height. The results indicate that relative roughness is most associated with frictional resistance coefficient (FRC), whereas Reynolds number was unrelated to that. The ratio of frictional head loss to total head loss of the basin does not vary with the variation of channel velocity, and the ratio is always less than 6% in this case.

The archetypal zeolite material has now been joined by an eclectic array of new structures that exhibit porosity over a wide range of length scales and with order/disorder expressed in a multitude of ways. This raises the bar in terms of characterization and extends a real challenge to the scientific community to fully understand the properties and potential future applications of such materials. In this review we discuss the importance of modern microscopy tools combined with diffraction in this endeavour and show how the details of even the most complex quasi-crystalline nanoporous architectures can be elucidated. We show by using the appropriate spherical aberration (Cs) corrections in scanning transmission electron microscopy it is possible to decipher all the individual silicon and aluminum atoms in a zeolite structure. Automated routines for using large electron diffraction datasets for crystal structure determination of nanocrystals is described making the need for large single crystal synthesis less-and-less important. The power of complementary combinations of surface tools such as atomic force microscopy and high-resolution scanning electron microscopy is discussed to elucidate crystal growth mechanisms. For mesoporous materials synthesized from self-organized organic mesophases electron microscopy reveals the details of the complex hierarchy of porosity so crucial for the functional performance of the structure. \u00a9 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is the most common target for clinical treatment using DBS. While STN-DBS can significantly improve motor symptoms in PD patients, adverse cognitive effects have also been reported. The specific effects of STN-DBS on cognitive function and the related mechanisms remain unclear. Thus, it is imperative to identify the influence of STN-DBS on cognition and investigate the potential mechanisms to provide a clearer view of the various cognitive sequelae in PD patients. For this review, a literature search was performed using the following inclusion criteria: (1) at least 10 patients followed for a mean of at least 6 months after surgery since the year 2006; (2) pre- and postoperative cognitive data using at least one standardized neuropsychological scale; and (3) adequate reporting of study results using means and standard deviations. Of \u223c170 clinical studies identified, 25 cohort studies (including 15 self-controlled studies, nine intergroup controlled studies, and one multi-center, randomized control experiment) and one metaanalysis were eligible for inclusion. The results suggest that the precise mechanism of the changes in cognitive function after STN-DBS remains obscure, but STN-DBS certainly has effects on cognition. In particular, a progressive decrease in verbal fluency after STN-DBS is consistently reported and although executive function is unchanged in the intermediate stage postoperatively, it tends to decline in the early and later stages. However, these changes do not affect the improvements in quality of life. STN-DBS seems to be safe with respect to cognitive effects in carefully-selected patients during a follow-up period from 6 months to 9 years. \u00a9 2014 Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.", "pid": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1517cc8c"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Xican Li", "org": "School of Chinese Herbal Medicine", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1501eca1"}, {"name": "Qian Fang", "org": "School of Chinese Herbal Medicine", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1507f434"}, {"name": "Jing Lin", "org": "School of Chinese Herbal Medicine", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1504e47d"}, {"name": "Zhengpeng Yuan", "org": "School of Chinese Herbal Medicine", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e1500666d"}, {"name": "Lu Han", "org": "School of Chinese Herbal Medicine", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151af550"}, {"name": "Yaoxiang Gao", "org": "School of Chinese Herbal Medicine", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1517183f"}], "title": "Chemistry study on protective effect against \u2022OH-induced DNA damage and antioxidant mechanism of cortex magnoliae officinalis", "keywords": ["Antioxidant", "Cortex Magnoliae Officinalis", "DNA damage", "Hydroxyl radical", "Phenylpropanoid"], "venue": "Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society", "year": 2014, "abstract": "As a Chinese herbal medicine used in East Asia for thousands years, Cortex Magnoliae Officinalis (CMO) was observed to possess a protective effect against \u2022OH-induced DNA damage in the study.

However, a considerable portion of the patients does not respond to trastuzumab and the molecular mechanisms underlying the intrinsic resistance to anti-HER2 therapy in GC is not fully understood. Methods: We performed whole-transcriptome sequencing on 21 HER2-positive tumor specimens from Chinese GC patients. Whole genome sequencing was performed on the three samples with HER2 fusion to discover the DNA integration structure. A multicolor FISH assay for HER2 split screening was conducted to confirm HER2 fusion and IHC (HercepTest\u2122) was used to detect the membranous expression of HER2. Fusion cDNA were transfected into NIH/3T3 cells and generate stable cell line by lentivirus. The expression of exogenous HER2 fusion proteins and pHER2 were examined by western blot analysis. In vitro efficacy studies were also conducted by PD assay and softagar assay in cell line expression wild type and fusion HER2. T-DM1 was used to assess its binding to NIH/3T3 cells ectopically expressing wild-type and fusion HER2. Finally, the anti-tumor efficacy of trastuzumab was tested in NIH/3 T3 xenografts expressing the HER2 fusion variants. Results: We identified three new HER2 fusions with ZNF207, MDK, or NOS2 in 21 HER2-amplified GC samples (14%; 3/21). Two of the fusions, ZNF207-HER2, and MDK-HER2, which are oncogenic, lead to aberrant activation of HER2 kinase. Treatment with trastuzumab inhibited tumor growth significantly in xenografts expressing MDK-HER2 fusion. In contrast, trastuzumab had no effect on the growth of xenografts expressing ZNF207-HER2 fusion, due to its inability to bind to trastuzumab. Conclusions: Our results provide the molecular basis of a novel resistance mechanism to trastuzumab-based anti-HER2 therapy, supporting additional molecule stratification within HER2-positive GC patients for more effective therapy options.", "pid": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15124979"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Yixiao Zhao", "org": "School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e151f9f32"}, {"name": "Shujian Yu", "org": "Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e151820aa"}, {"name": "Jinghui Wu", "org": "School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fe8d9b"}, {"name": "Lu Han", "org": "School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150c3a5f"}, {"name": "Zijing Chen", "org": "Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fb1b8f"}, {"name": "Xiaopeng Yang", "org": "School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150c93a9"}, {"name": "Baojun Zhao", "org": "School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f4a935"}], "title": "Data-driven bridge detection in compressed domain from panchromatic satellite imagery", "keywords": ["Bridge detection", "Compressed domain", "Data-driven", "Panchromatic satellite imagery", "Remote sensing"], "venue": "Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)", "year": 2014, "abstract": "Bridge detection in panchromatic imagery is of great importance in civilian and military applications. Popular algorithms for bridge detection are often based on a priori knowledge to bridge structure or location features, where manually- introduced decision rules are incorporated into a complex algorithm in spatial domain. Instead of knowledge-based approach in spatial domain, in this paper, we proposed a fast data-driven algorithm in compressed domain for panchromatic satellite imagery.

Chlorogenic acid, which is an effective component of Chinese medicine and a heat-sensitive substance, is not stable at high operation temperature. Chlorogenic acid with molecular weight of 354 Da and good solubility in water can be treated by nanofiltration (NF) membrane. In this work, polyetherimide (PEI) ultrafiltration (UF) membrane with good chemical and thermal stability is used in the purification of chlorogenic acid solution. Positively charged HACC/PEI NF membrane with good antibacterial performance and hydrophilicity is used to concentrate chlorogenic acid solution. It is found that, the PEI UF membrane can separate chlorogenic acid with other components and improve the purity of chlorogenic acid. At the same time, the rejection to chlorogenic acid of the positively charged NF membrane is about 92% which is suitable for the concentration of chlorogenic acid solution.

However, many existing studies have yielded inconclusive results. This meta-analysis aims to assess the prognostic value of CTC in patients with pancreatic cancer. An extensive literary search for relevant studies was conducted on PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, CISCOM, CINAHL, Google Scholar, CNKI, and CBM databases from their inception through July 1, 2013. The meta-analysis was then performed using the Stata 12.0 software. Crude hazard ratios (HRs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated under a fixed or random effect model. Nine cohort studies were included in this meta-analysis with a total of 623 pancreatic cancer patients. This number included 268 CTC-positive patients and 355 CTC-negative patients. Our meta-analysis revealed that patients in the CTC-positive group were significantly associated with poor progression-free survival (PFS) (HR = 1.89, 95 % CI = 1.25-4.00, P < 0.001). Furthermore, pancreatic cancer patients in the CTC-positive group also showed worse overall survival (OS) than those in the CTC-negative group (HR = 1.23, 95 % CI = 0.88-2.08, P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis by ethnicity indicated that CTC-positive patients had poor OS among both Asian and Caucasian populations (all P < 0.05). Further subgroup analyses by detection and treatment methods also suggested that CTC-positive patients showed worser OS than CTC-negative patients in the majority of subgroups (all P < 0.05). No publication bias was detected in this meta-analysis. In conclusion, our meta-analysis suggests that CTC-positive pancreatic cancer patients may have worser PFS and OS than CTC-negative patients. Detection of CTC in peripheral blood may be a promising biomarker for the detection and prognosis of pancreatic cancer. \u00a9 2013 International Society of Oncology and BioMarkers (ISOBM).", "pid": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e151fb732"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Lu Han", "org": "Department of Computer Science, Shandong University(Weihai)", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e15172622"}, {"name": "Aili Han", "org": "Department of Computer Science, Shandong University(Weihai)", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f8ec22"}], "title": "An edge detection algorithm based on morphological gradient and the Otsu method", "keywords": ["Edge detection", "Gradient", "Morphology operator"], "venue": "Communications in Computer and Information Science", "year": 2014, "abstract": "An edge detection algorithm based on the morphology gradient is presented to extract the edge pixels of grey-level image and convert the edge image to bi-level image by means of the Otsu method.

To pinpoint all the polio cases in time, AFP surveillance system was expanded to include persons of all ages in the entire population in Xinjiang.Results: Totally, 578 AFP cases were reported in 2011 in Xinjiang, including 21 WPV cases, 23 clinical compatible polio cases and 534 non-polio AFP cases. Of the 44 polio cases, 27 (61.4%) cases were reported among adults aged 15-53 years. Strengthening AFP surveillance resulted in an increase in the number of non-polio AFP cases in 2011 (148 children < 15 years) compared with 76 cases < 15 years in 2010. The AFP surveillance system in Xinjiang was sensitive enough to detect polio cases, with the AFP incidence of 3.28/100,000 among children < 15 years of age.Conclusions: Incorporating adult cases into the AFP surveillance system is of potential value to understand the overall characteristics of the epidemic and to guide emergency responses, especially in countries facing WPV outbreak following long-term polio free status. The AFP surveillance system in Xinjiang was satisfactory despite limitations in biological sample collection. \u00a9 2014 Wen et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "pid": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e151343e9"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Qiang Qu", "org": "Xiangya Hospital", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f6564f"}, {"name": "Jian Qu", "org": "Institute of Clinical Pharmacology", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f4c82d"}, {"name": "Lu Han", "org": "Xiangya Hospital", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1515aa2a"}, {"name": "Min Zhan", "org": "Institute of Clinical Pharmacology", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e1520d837"}, {"name": "Lan-Xiang Wu", "org": "Institute of Life Sciences", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fe5908"}, {"name": "Yi-Wen Zhang", "org": "Institute of Clinical Pharmacology", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e15040b6f"}, {"name": "Wei Zhang", "org": "Institute of Clinical Pharmacology", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e151991ba"}, {"name": "Hong-Hao Zhou", "org": "Institute of Clinical Pharmacology", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151f0857"}], "title": "Inhibitory effects of phytochemicals on metabolic capabilities of CYP2D6\u22171 and CYP2D6\u221710 using cell-based models in vitro", "keywords": ["bilobalide", "coptisine", "CYP2D6", "drug interaction", "herbal medicine", "luteolin", "puerarin", "schizandrin"], "venue": "Acta Pharmacologica Sinica", "year": 2014, "abstract": "Aim: Herbal products have been widely used, and the safety of herb-drug interactions has aroused intensive concerns. This study aimed to investigate the effects of phytochemicals on the catalytic activities of human CYP2D6\u22171 and CYP2D6\u221710 in vitro. Methods: HepG2 cells were stably transfected with CYP2D6\u22171 and CYP2D6\u221710 expression vectors. The metabolic kinetics of the enzymes was studied using HPLC and fluorimetry. Results: HepG2-CYP2D6\u22171 and HepG2-CYP2D6\u221710 cell lines were successfully constructed.

Thus herbal products containing these phytochemicals may inhibit the in vivo metabolism of co-administered drugs whose primary route of elimination is CYP2D6.", "pid": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150a6dff"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Lu Han", "org": "Department of Chemistry, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150b4d9a"}, {"name": "Xinxin Zhong", "org": "Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciences, College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Peking University", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15125abb"}, {"name": "Wanzhen Liang", "org": "Department of Chemistry, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f533b5"}, {"name": "Yi Zhao", "org": "Department of Chemistry, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f59e70"}], "title": "Energy relaxation and separation of a hot electron-hole pair in organic aggregates from a time-dependent wavepacket diffusion method", "venue": "Journal of Chemical Physics", "year": 2014, "abstract": "The time-dependent wavepacket diffusive method [X.

The pair initial condition generated by laser pulse is represented by a Gaussian wavepacket with a central momentum. The results reveal that the hot electron energy relaxation is very well described by two rate processes with the fast rate much larger than the slow one, consistent with experimental observations, and an efficient electron-hole separation is accomplished accompanying the fast energy relaxation. Furthermore, although the extra energy indeed helps the separation by overcoming the Coulomb interaction, the width of initial wavepacket is much sensitive to the separation efficiency and the narrower wavepacket generates the more separated charges. This behavior may be useful to understand the experimental controversy of the hot carrier effect on charge separation. \u00a9 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.", "pid": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e15168657"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Lu Han", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Physical Chemistry of Solid Surfaces, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150b4d9a"}, {"name": "Yaling Ke", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Physical Chemistry of Solid Surfaces, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15febcc0"}, {"name": "Xinxin Zhong", "org": "Min.-of-Education Key Laboratory for the Synthesis and Application of Organic Functional Molecules, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Hubei University", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15125abb"}, {"name": "Yi Zhao", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Physical Chemistry of Solid Surfaces, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f59e70"}], "title": "Time-dependent wavepacket diffusion method and its applications in organic semiconductors", "keywords": ["band-like motion", "carrier-phonon interaction", "hopping-type motion", "organic semiconductor", "time-dependent wavepacket diffusion method"], "venue": "International Journal of Quantum Chemistry", "year": 2015, "abstract": "In organic materials, the carrier-phonon interaction plays an important role for the carrier transport process.

The Ti substrates were functionalized through a three-step process: alkali treatment, silanization with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane and aldehydation with glutaraldehyde (GA). BMP2-encapsulated CS coatings (BMP2-CS) were bonded to Ti surfaces through reactions between the aldehyde groups of GA and the amine groups of CS. Direct BMP2 immobilization on aldehyde-treated Ti (BMP2-Ti) and pure CS coatings (CS-Ti) were used as controls. The release rate of BMP2-CS-Ti was half of that of BMP2-Ti at initial stage, which indicates that the CS coatings are suitable carriers for sustained BMP2 release. The osteoinductivities of BMP2-CS-Ti, BMP2-Ti, CS-Ti and pristine Ti were examined by both in vitro cell tests and in vivo experiments. Bone marrow stem cell (BMSC) culture indicated that BMP2-CS-Ti is more potent in stimulating the differentiation of the adhering BMSC than the three other groups. Rabbit femur implantation revealed the excellent osteoinductivity of BMP2-CS-coated Ti implants. These results demonstrate that the BMP2-encapsulated CS coatings are stable osteoinductive coatings that realize the sustained release of BMP2 and maintain the activity of the protein. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier B.V.", "pid": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fa96a1"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Lu Han", "org": "Key Lab of Advanced Technologies of Materials, Ministry of Education, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e15089585"}, {"name": "Zhen-ming Wang", "org": "Key Lab of Advanced Technologies of Materials, Ministry of Education, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151acb10"}, {"name": "Xiong Lu", "org": "Key Lab of Advanced Technologies of Materials, Ministry of Education, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e151029a2"}, {"name": "Li Dong", "org": "Key Lab of Advanced Technologies of Materials, Ministry of Education, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15017684"}, {"name": "Chao-ming Xie", "org": "Key Lab of Advanced Technologies of Materials, Ministry of Education, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1509ddb6"}, {"name": "Ke-feng Wang", "org": "National Engineering Research Center for Biomaterials, Sichuan University", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e15041596"}, {"name": "Xiao-lang Chen", "org": "Key Lab of Advanced Technologies of Materials, Ministry of Education, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1504dd53"}, {"name": "Yong-hui Ding", "org": "Dept. of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Materials Characterisation and Preparation Facility, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150e122e"}, {"name": "Lu-tao Weng", "org": "Dept. of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Materials Characterisation and Preparation Facility, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f6c23d"}], "title": "Mussel-inspired adhesive and transferable free-standing films by self-assembling dexamethasone encapsulated BSA nanoparticles and vancomycin immobilized oxidized alginate", "keywords": ["BSA nanoparticles", "Dexamethasone", "Free-standing films", "Oxidized alginate", "Self-assembly", "Vancomycin"], "venue": "Colloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces", "year": 2015, "abstract": "This study developed an adhesive and transferable free-standing (FS) film with dual function of osteoinductivity and antibacterial activity, which was obtained by sequentially assembling vancomycin immobilized oxidized sodium alginate and dexamethasone encapsulated chitosan coated BSA nanoparticles on a poly-dopamine layer.

However, this relationship has not been established in populations with very low levels of 25(OH)D. Therefore, the aim of our study was to clarify the associations between 25(OH)D and blood pressure, obesity, sex, and lipid profiles in the Kazak ethnic population, who have an extremely low level of 25(OH)D. Material/Methods: A multistage-cluster sampling survey was carried out for residents with Kazak ethnicity in Xinjiang, China. Anthropometric measurements of each participant were taken and the concentrations of 25(OH)D, calcium, alkaline phosphatase, and lipid profiles were measured. Individuals were classified into different groups in terms of vitamin D status, degree of adiposity, presence of hypertension, and other comorbidities. Results: The madian concentration of 25(OH)D was 16.2 (11.8-20.5) ng/mL and the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was 72.4% in this Kazak population (n=928, 59.0% women). Females had a lower 25(OH)D concentration than males - 14.6 (10.5-19.4) ng/mL vs. 17.7 (14.8-22.5) ng/mL, P<0.001. The subjects were classified into 3 groups according to their vitamin D status. There were significant differences in BMI (P=0.046), waist circumference (P=0.037), hip circumference (P=0.003), systolic BP (P=0.035), and LDL cholesterol (P=0.008) among the groups after adjustment for sex and age. On the other hand, there was no significant difference in vitamin D levels between groups with or without hypertension (P=0.586), and groups with or without obesity (P=0.639). A multifactor-regression analysis revealed that every increment of 1mg/dL in LDL cholesterol was associated with a 1.0 ng/mL decline in serum 25(OH)D. Conclusions: The insufficiency of vitamin D is highly prevalent in Kazaks. Sex, LDL cholesterol, and hip circumference are 3 variables strongly associated with serum 25(OH)D concentration. In a population with low levels of 25(OH)D, the negative relationship between obesity and serum 25(OH)D, a common finding from most previous studies, could not be established. \u00a9 Med Sci Monit, 2014.", "pid": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ff83ee"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Xinjuan Xu", "org": "Department of Hypertension, First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fd2a73"}, {"name": "Jiangfeng Mao", "org": "Department of Endocrinology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Key aboratory of Endocrinology, Ministry of Health", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1504328f"}, {"name": "Mingchen Zhang", "org": "Department of Endocrinology, First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University", "id": "5b5433e3e1cd8e4e15f46547"}, {"name": "Haiming Liu", "org": "Department of Hypertension, First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e150068f9"}, {"name": "Haixia Li", "org": "Department of Hypertension, First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1505f0fe"}, {"name": "Hong Lei", "org": "Department of Hypertension, First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fe2721"}, {"name": "Lu Han", "org": "Department of Cardiology, Xinjiang Armed Police Hospital", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fddda9"}, {"name": "Min Gao", "org": "Department of Hypertension, First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e1519b013"}], "title": "Vitamin D deficiency in Uygurs and Kazaks is associated with polymorphisms in CYP2R1 and DHCR7/NADSYN1 genes", "keywords": ["Calcifediol", "Ethnic groups", "Genetic", "Polymorphism"], "venue": "Medical Science Monitor", "year": 2015, "abstract": "Background: Our study is aimed to 1) clarify the vitamin D status in Uygur and Kazak ethnic populations and 2) elucidate the relationship between 14 SNPs (in 5 vitamin D-related genes) and vitamin D deficiency in these 2 ethnic populations. Material/Methods: A multistage-cluster sampling survey was carried out for residents with Uygur or Kazak ethnicity in Xinjiang, China. Anthropometric measurements were taken and the concentrations of 25OHD were measured. Fourteen common variants in VDR, GC, CYP2R1, CYP27B1, and DHCR7/NADSYN1 were genotyped by using multiple SNaPshot assay. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the possible risk factors for vitamin D deficiency, after adjusting for several environmental and biological factors. The pattern of SNP associations was distinct between Uygurs and Kazaks. Results: Anthropometric measurements and the concentrations of 25OHD were obtained from 1873 participants (945 Uygur ethnic and 928 Kazak ethnic). The genotypes of 14 SNPs were measured for 300 Uygurs and 300 Kazaks. The median 25OHD concentration was as low as 10.4 ng/ml in Uygurs and 16.2ng/ml in Kazaks. In Uygurs, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, in-sufficiency, and sufficiency was 91.2%, 5.8%, and 3.0%, respectively. CYP2R1-rs10766197 was significantly associated with the presence of vitamin D deficiency in the Uygur ethnic population (P=0.019, OR=6.533, 95%C.I.: 361\u201331.357), while DHCR7/NADSYN1-rs12785878 was significantly associated with the presence of vitamin D deficiency in the Kazak ethnic population (P=0.011, OR=2.442, 95%C.I.: 1.224\u20134.873).

Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) culture tests confirm that the bare nanostructured architectures intrinsically facilitate attachment, proliferation, and differentiation of cells, which is attributed to the nanoscale porous structures that are similar to the size of cellular filopodia. Incorporating BMP-2 into the nanostructured architectures significantly enhances osteogenetic differentiation of BMSCs, which reveals the synergistic effects of nanostructures and growth factors on cell activity. The antibacterial tests indicate that controlled release of Van has good antibacterial ability against Staphylococcus epidermidis, while not affecting the normal biological activity of BMSCs. The preparation of BMP-2 loaded cationic nanoparticles (CBNPs) and vancomycin (Van) loaded anionic nanoparticles (OCBNPs) is presented. The CBNPs and OCBNPs are assembled on Ti surfaces to construct nanostructured architectures via electrostatic and covalent interactions.

Consequently, the HERA and RBCA models yielded the identical results for Site-Specific Assessment Criteria (SSAC) under the commercial redevelopment.

The inhalation of indoor vapors was the most predominated exposure pathway for all the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) determined using the RBCA and HERA models.

Methyl orange (MO) served as the representative organic contaminant for verifying the effectiveness of the composite. Using decolorization efficiency as an indicator of treatment effectiveness, increasing doses of nZVI/BC yielded progressively better results with 98.51% of MO decolorized by 0.6 g/L of composite at an nZVI/BC mass ratio of 1:5. The superior decolorization efficiency of the nZVI/BC was attributed to the increase in the dispersion and reactivity of nZVI while biochar increasing the contact area with contaminant and the adsorption of composites. Additionally, the buffering function of acid-washed biochar could be in favor of maintaining the reactivity of nZVI. Furthermore, the aging nZVI/BC for 30 day was able to maintain the removal efficiency indicating that the oxidation of nZVI may be delayed in the presence of biochar.

In this study, peripheral blood samples from 20 healthy controls and 54 consented CRC patients, and tumor and matched paraneoplastic tissues from 7 patients with advanced CRC, subjected to multicolor flow cytometric analysis of the expression of PD-1 and Tim-3 receptors on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.

The electrostatically self-assembled MLNs were constructed by TAT peptide modified mesoporous silica nanoparticles (TAT-MSN) as the cationic core for DOX loading, poly(allylamine hydrochloride)-citraconic anhydride (PAH-Cit) as the anionic inner layer, and galactose-modified trimethyl chitosan-cysteine (GTC) conjugate as the cationic outer layer to encapsulate siRNA. Their strong stability at pH 7.4 and 6.5 protected siRNA from degradation in the blood and tumor microenvironment. Galactose ligands on the GTC outer layers effectively facilitated the internalization of MLNs through receptor-mediated endocytosis. Afterwards, the endosomal/lysosomal acidity (pH 5.0) triggered the charge reversal of PAH-Cit, thereby inducing the disassembly of MLNs and their escape to the cytosol. Cytoplasmic glutathione further accelerated siRNA release through cleaving disulfide bonds in GTC layers, leading to high silencing efficiencies. Meanwhile, the exposed DOX-loaded cores were transported into the nuclei by virtue of TAT peptide and exhibited sustained release thereafter. As a result, potent antitumor efficacies of MLNs were noted following intravenous injection at a low dose with no apparent toxicity detected.

Increasing evidence suggests that dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) may be involved in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. Herein, we report that the permeability of the BBB is increased and that AD-like alterations are present in Slit-2 overexpressing transgenic mice. We found that behavioral change and the corresponding molecular diagnostic markers of AD, such as hippocampal neuron apoptosis, amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) protein deposition, and acetylcholinesterase expression, were increased in the Slit-2 transgenic mice. Moreover, the endothelial cells were dysfunctional, the size of the lateral ventricle cavity increased, and the permeability of the BBB increased. Additionally, there was an increased serum level of glutamate indicating that the BBB is related to AD. Finally, histopathological analysis of other organs in the Slit-2 overexpressing mice did not show any marked abnormalities. These findings demonstrate that Slit2 overexpression may be responsible for AD-like alterations and the increased BBB permeability in these mice. Our study provides a potential novel mechanism for the development of AD. Supplementary Figure 1. The other organ's abnormal structure of Slit-2 overxpression mice is not observed.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small endogenous non-coding RNAs with 20\u201324\u00a0nt. They have been identified in many plants with their diverse regulatory roles in biotic stresses. The knowledge, that miRNAs regulate late blight (LB), caused by Phytophthora infestans, is rather limited. In this study, we used miRNA-Seq to investigate the miRNA expression difference between the tomatoes treated with and without P. infestans. A total of 42,714,516 raw reads were generated from two small RNA libraries by high-throughput sequencing. Finally, 207 known miRNAs and 67 new miRNAs were obtained. The differential expression profile of miRNAs in tomato was further analyzed with twofold change (P value \u22640.01). A total of 70 miRNAs were manifested to change significantly in samples treated with P. infestans, including 50 down-regulated miRNAs and 20 up-regulated miRNAs. Moreover, a total of 73 target genes were acquired for 28 differentially expressed miRNAs by psRNATarget analysis. By enrichment pathway analysis of target genes, plant\u2013pathogen interaction was the most highly relevant pathway which played an important role in disease defense. In addition, 30 miRNAs were selected for qRT-PCR to validate their expression patterns. The expression patterns for targets of miR6027, miR5300, miR476b, miR159a, miR164a and miRn13 were selectively examined, and the results showed that there was a negative correlation on the expression patterns between miRNAs and their targets. The targets have previously been reported to be related with plant immune and involved in plant\u2013pathogen interaction pathway in this study, suggesting these miRNAs might act as regulators in process of tomato resistance against P. infestans. These discoveries will provide us useful information to explain tomato resistance mechanisms against LB.", "pid": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1508f04a"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Hang Li", "org": "Department of Chemistry, Harbin Institute of Technology", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15114d5f"}, {"name": "Songtao Lu", "org": "Department of Chemistry, Harbin Institute of Technology", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151b3aa8"}, {"name": "Wei Qin", "org": "School of Materials Science and Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15008a6f"}, {"name": "Lu Han", "org": "Department of Chemistry, Harbin Institute of Technology", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e150951e9"}, {"name": "Xiaohong Wu", "org": "Department of Chemistry, Harbin Institute of Technology", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e151fd57c"}], "title": "Improving the wear properties of AZ31 magnesium alloy under vacuum low-temperature condition by plasma electrolytic oxidation coating", "keywords": ["Al doping", "Magnesium alloy", "Plasma electrolytic oxidation", "Vacuum low-temperature", "Wear properties"], "venue": "Acta Astronautica", "year": 2015, "abstract": "Abstract In this paper, Al-doped ceramic coatings with a thickness of 22-27 \u03bcm were prepared on AZ31 magnesium alloy by plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) in electrolytes that contain varied concentrations of NaAlO<inf>2</inf>, aiming to improve its wear resistance under vacuum low-temperature (-50\u00b0C) condition.

However, the protective mechanism of DADS against radiation-induced mouse testis cell apoptosis has not been elucidated. In this study, the magnitude of radiation effects evoked by carbon ion irradiation was marked by morphology changes, significant rise in apoptotic cells, activation expression of p53, up regulation the ratio of pro-apoptotic Tap73/anti-apoptotic Np73, as well as alterations of crucial mediator of the mitochondrial pathway. Interestingly, pretreatment with DADS attenuated carbon ion irradiation-induced morphology damages and apoptotic cells. Additionally, DADS elevated radiation-induced p53 and p21 expression, suggesting that p53 might be involved in the inhibition of cell cycle progression through up regulation of p21. Furthermore, administration with DADS prevented radiation-induced Tap73/Np73 expression and consequently down regulated Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, cytochrome c release and caspase-3 expression, indicating that the balance between Tap73 and Np73 had potential to activate p53 responsive genes. Thus, our results showed that radio protection effect of DADS on mouse testis is mediated by blocking apoptosis through changing the ratio of Tap73/Np73 via mitochondrial pathway, suggesting that DADS could be used as a potential radio protection agent for the testis against heavy-ion radiation.", "pid": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1517a1b9"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Xiangang Jiang", "org": "Offshore Oil Engineer Co.

However, the molecular mechanisms associated with micro-RNAs (miRNAs) whereby ADSCs respond to mechanical stimuli remain elusive. We investigated the mechanism of mechanotransduction from the miRNA perspective in the osteogenic differentiation of ADSCs under tensile stress. Microarray analysis showed that miR-154-5p was remarkably downregulated when ADSCs were subjected to mechanical tension. Bioinformatics analysis with luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that Wnt11 3'UTR was a new direct target of miR-154-5p. Under tensile stress, lentivirus-mediated gain- or loss-of-function studies revealed that forced expression of miR-154-5p inhibited osteogenic differentiation of ADSCs, whereas inhibition of endogenous miR-154-5p with its antisense oligonucleotide (ASO-154-5p) obviously promoted osteogenic differentiation. Furthermore, miR-154-5p overexpression decreased activity of the non-canonical Wnt/PCP (RhoA-ROCK) pathway, as indicated by lower expression of Wnt11, active RhoA and ROCKII in miR-154-5p-treated ADSCs. By contrast, miR-154-5p inhibition activated the Wnt/PCP signals. Taken together, these results demonstrate that, under tensile stress, miR-154-5p negatively regulates ADSCs osteogenic differentiation through the Wnt/PCP pathway by directly targeting Wnt11.
