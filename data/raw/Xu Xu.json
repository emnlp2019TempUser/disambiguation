However, there are few information on ocular biocompatibility of polymeric nanoparticles applied topically onto the eye. In this paper, the ocular biocompatibility and tolerance of methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) (MPEG-PCL) micelles (~50. nm) were investigated in rabbit eyes after a single intracameral and intravitreal injections. In vitro cytotoxicity assays showed that MPEG-PCL micelles had no apparent cytotoxicity against human corneal epithelial cells (HCEC), human lens epithelial cells (HLEC), and retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE cells) at micelle concentrations of 0-2. mg/mL. After a single intracameral injection of 0.2. mL MPEG-PCL micelles (200. mg/mL) into rabbit eyes, MPEG-PCL micelles were slowly removed from aqueous humor in a period of 14 days, while the intraocular pressure (IOP) was maintained at nearly the same level for 15 days. Three days after intracameral injection, dual staining of corneal endothelium showed that the endothelial cells were nearly regular hexagon-shape with well-defined organization, similar to normal endothelial cells. Hematoxylin and eosin staining indicated that there was absence of any obvious changes in microstructure of the corneal tissue and retina after a single intracameral and intravitreal injection of 0.2. mL MPEG-PCL micelles (100. mg/mL, 150. mg/mL, and 200. mg/mL).

It was shown that thermal conductivity of the suspensions increases with increasing the loading of the carbon additives and the extent of relative increase depends strongly on their size and shape. Of the various carbon nanomaterials examined, GNPs caused greatest increase due to reduced thermal interface resistance associated with their two-dimensional planar structure.

At various intensive pulsed heat loads, comparisons were made between two PCMs with close thermophysical properties but different melting temperatures. The performance of an unfinned heat sink was also compared with its finned version. It was found that the use of a PCM with a higher melting temperature can extend a longer time of protection of the target devices from overheating, and that it also facilitates cooling for recovering the heat sink for subsequent operations. A lower melting temperature, however, is possibly favored because it may enable a prompt protection of the target devices. Selection of the PCM with an appropriate melting temperature depends strongly on the thermal conditions exerted. In contrast, employment of internal fins was shown to be always preferred as the performance of the heat sink can be improved, regardless of the PCM adopted.

Therefore, elucidation of glycosyltransferases and their substrates may improve our understanding of their roles in tumor metastasis. \u03b2-1,3-N- acetylglucosaminyltransferase-8 (\u03b23GnT8) is a key enzyme that catalyzes the formation of poly-N-acetyllactosamine (polylactosamine) chains on \u03b21,6-branched N-glycans in vitro, which is also involved in tumor invasion. In the present study, we analyzed the expression of \u03b23GnT8 and its product polylactosamine in four human colorectal carcinoma cell lines (LS-174T, SW620, SW480 and LoVo) with different metastatic potential. We found that the levels of \u03b23GnT8 and polylactosamine chains were gradually increased in the colorectal cancer cell lines in a trend from low to high metastatic potential. Notably, a significantly positive relationship between \u03b23GnT8 expression and HG-CD147 was noted in the colorectal cancer cell lines. To further investigate their relationships, exogenous \u03b23GnT8 was introduced into the LS-174T cells, while expression of \u03b23GnT8 was downregulated in the LoVo cells. The overexpression of \u03b23GnT8 in LS-174T cells increased the level of HG-CD147. Conversely, downregulation of \u03b23GnT8 expression in LoVo cells significantly decreased the expression of HG-CD147. HG-CD147 is a major carrier of \u03b21,6-branched polylactosamine sugars; therefore, the regulation of \u03b23GnT8 significantly altered the \u03b21,6-branched polylactosamine structures on CD147. Hence, we suggest that \u03b23GnT8 plays a key role in the metastasis of colorectal cancer cells by altering the \u03b21,6-branched polylactosamine sugars of CD147.", "pid": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e1519d60d"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Li Shen", "org": "Department of Clinical Oncology, Taihe Hospital, Hubei University of Medicine", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e15210925"}, {"name": "Meiyun Yu", "org": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Soochow University", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e151725e1"}, {"name": "Xu Xu", "org": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Soochow University", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150d7e26"}, {"name": "Liping Gao", "org": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Soochow University", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fa431c"}, {"name": "Jianlong Ni", "org": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Soochow University", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1515a7f1"}, {"name": "Zhiguo Luo", "org": "Department of Clinical Oncology, Taihe Hospital, Hubei University of Medicine", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151be147"}, {"name": "Shiliang Wu", "org": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Soochow University", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15019860"}], "title": "Knockdown of \u03b23GnT8 reverses 5-fluorouracil resistance in human colorectal cancer cells via inhibition the biosynthesis of polylactosamine-type N-glycans", "keywords": ["5-fluorouracil resistance", "Colorectal cancer", "Polylactosamine", "\u03b23GnT8"], "venue": "International Journal of Oncology", "year": 2014, "abstract": "Aberrant glycosylation is known to be associated with cancer chemoresistance. \u03b2-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (\u03b23GnT)8, which synthesizes polylactosamine on \u03b2l-6 branched N-glycans, is dramatically upregulated in colorectal cancer (CRC). 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) resistance remains a major obstacle to the chemotherapy of CRC. However, little is known with regard to the correlation between 5-FU resistance and the expression of \u03b23GnT8 in CRC. In this study, a 5-FU-resistant cell line (SW620/5-FU) was generated, and 50% inhibition concentration (IC50) of 5-FU was determined by MTT assay. Flow cytometry and lectin blot analysis were performed to detect the alteration of polylactosamine structures. Quantitative RT-PCR and western blot analysis were used to identify and evaluate candidate genes involved in the synthesis of polylactosamine in SW620/5-FU cells. We found polylactosamine chains were significantly increased in SW620/5-FU cells. Inhibition of the biosynthesis of polylactosamine by 3'-azidothymidine (AZT) was able to reduce 5-FU tolerance. Further studies showed that \u03b23GnT8 expression was also upregulated in 5-FU-resistant cancer cells, and knockdown of \u03b23GnT8 by RNA interference reversed 5-FU resistance through, at least partly, by suppressing the formation of polylactosamine.

Research has been widely carried out with calculation of lightening flash-over rate of transmission lines. In calculation of lightning flash-over rate of transmission lines, the selection of random processes is very important for the speed and the precision of the calculation. In this paper, the lightening flashover rate of transmission lines is studied by using a modified Monte Carlo method. Typical tower parameters of 110 kV, 220 kV and 500 kV transmission lines are selected and the electric geometry method is introduced. The probability of hitting the tower under different kinds of landscape and the shield failure flashover rate under different obliquities are calculated. The back flash-over rate as well as the shield failure flash-over rate of typical towers before and after considering the power frequency voltage is also calculated. The influence of stroke current, front time, the hitting point, transient power frequency voltage and windage yaw on the lightning flash-over rate of transmission line is analyzed. On the basis of analyses above and considering the speed and the precision of the calculation, it is found that the random processes including stroke current, the hitting part and power frequency voltage of back flashover are crucial in the Monte Carlo method.

With this method, the calculation of SFFOR in a mountainous area is more complicate than that in the plain. In order to improve the precision of calculation of SFFOR under conditions of complex landscape in a mountainous area, the SFFOR under conditions of complex landscape in a mountainous area is studied on basis of the field investigation and by using Monte Carlo method and improved electro-geometric (EGM) model. The calculation model under conditions of complex landscape in a mountainous area includes peak, hollow, slope, ditch and so on. The research results include the SFFOR characteristics with the variation of the slope angle, the depth of ditch and the height of the towers. The decrease of the shielding effect of ground is the main reason for the decrease of SFFOR. With the increase of the depth of ditch and the height of the towers, the SFFOR increases because of the decrease of the shielding effect. The same phenomenon appears when the variation of the slope angle increases beyond 20. Ditch under lines often is ignored in the previous design. But according to the present result, we found that it apparently influences the effects of ground shielding and the shielding failure flash-over rate.

Due to the presence of COHC, some of the former research results on MX should be revised. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We investigate the performance of a dynamic linear mixed-effects (DLME) model and marginal structural model (MSM) in evaluating dose-response from flexible-dose titration clinical trials via simulations. The simulation results demonstrated that DLME models with previous exposure as a time-varying covariate may provide an unbiased and efficient estimator to recover exposure-response relationship from flexible-dose clinical trials. Although the MSM models with independent and exchangeable working correlations appeared to be able to recover the right direction of the dose-response relationship, it tended to over-correct selection bias and overestimated the underlying true dose-response. The MSM estimators were also associated with large variability in the parameter estimates. Therefore, DLME may be an appropriate modeling option in identifying dose-response when data from fixed-dose studies are absent or a fixed-dose design is unethical to be implemented.

During the last few years, effects of Vitamin E supplementing in diet on semen quality and reproductive organs development were mainly studied and more attentions were paid on its mechanism. As it had been reported by our group that Vitamin E added in ration improved the density of spermatozoon, the motility density of spermatozoon and the motility of fresh semen. Vitamin E supplemented in diluent on quality of frozen-thawed semen by 2-step method of cryopreservation showed that the motility of frozen-thawed semen was higher, the integrity disrupted of frozen-thawed seminal acrosome was reduced and the percentage of the swelled and desquamated acrosome was decreased by supplementing Vitamin E. Vitamin E could increase motility of balanced semen and the frozen-thawed semen and decreased the percentage of membrane integrity disrupted of frozen-thawed seminal acrosome and swelled and desquamated acrosome. That study suggested that the motility of frozen-thawed semen was declining tardily within one hour after thawed, however it was sharply decreasing beyond that limit of one hour. So the artificial insemination of frozen-thawed semen should be carried out within one hour after thawed. Based on the studies above, we went on researching the effect of Vitamin E on its mechanism. The results showed that Vitamin E had a positive role in improving semen quality via protecting testicular cell membrane and mitochondria from antioxidant abilities and consequently protected the semen. Adding Vitamin E to diet could simulate the development of reproductive organs and protect testis from damage by preoxidation via enhancing the activities of antioxidant enzymes. Beside ram, we also studied, The results of the effects of fat-soluble vitamins on the efficiency of superovulation and embryo transfer in sheep showed that supplementing of Vitamin E or vitamins A and D could increase the embryo yield, the quality of embryos, and the number of lambs born, especially with the Vitamin E supplementation. We found that as a transfer protein, a-tocopherol transfer protein was very important to central nervous system and essential for maintaining tocopherol levels in brain. Tocopherol was involved in maintaining pregnancy and fetal development, which made us believe that this protein was one of the important key to study the mechanism of Vitamin E. As stated above, Vitamin E had positive effect on reproductive performance of sheep and goats and it was important to make further studies on the mechanism of Vitamin E to exert the function of Vitamin E. \u00a9 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

METHODS: HPLC was performed on a restricted access material Shiseido Capcell Pak MF SCX SG80 column. Phosphate buffered solution (90mmol/L, pH 3.5)-acetonitrile (ACN; 80/20, V/V) was chosen as the mobile phase. Separation was done at room temperature using a constant flow rate of 1.0mL/min. Fluorescence emission signal intensity at 330nm excited by 288nm ultra violet light was detected and measured. RESULTS: Thirty-eight gastric juice samples from patients with gastric cancer and 48 gastric juice samples of patients with benign gastric disease were tested. A linear relationship in the range of 0.20-100mg/L was obtained between the concentration of tryptophan and its fluorescence emission signal intensity at 330nm. The limit of detection was 0.05mg/L. The recovery rate was 77.4-90.6%.

It provides a shared virtual scenario where users represented by avatars participate in and interact with each other through networks. However, there are two technical challenges in designing an efficient DVE system with this architecture: view inconsistency caused by network delays and server overloading caused by uneven distribution of users. While the first problem affects users' perception of the VE and causes user disputes, the second problem affects the system response time. We present a new partitioning framework to simultaneously address the two problems, in which the DVE scenario is divided into a set of disjoint grids called virtual cells. The virtual cells are then indexed by a region quadtree and an algorithm is proposed to search the region quadtree so as to equally partition avatars among servers. By using probabilistic models to predict each avatar's future motion and the virtual region its area of interest (AOI) will cover, a density-based method is proposed to help each server construct avatar clusters from its local avatars in parallel. By estimating the possible distances of avatar's future position to the geometry center of each cluster, an algorithm is proposed to repartition non-assigned avatars among servers so as to reduce view inconsistency and preserve workload balancing among the servers. We conducted comprehensive experiments to evaluate our method by comparing it with other approaches. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.", "pid": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f9f880"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Yang Li", "org": "Beijing Engineering and Technology Research Center for Convergence Networks and Ubiquitous Services, University of Science and Technology Beijing (USTB)", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fb115f"}, {"name": "Xu Xu", "org": "Beijing Engineering and Technology Research Center for Convergence Networks and Ubiquitous Services, University of Science and Technology Beijing (USTB)", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151d69a9"}, {"name": "DanDan Zhang", "org": "Beijing Engineering and Technology Research Center for Convergence Networks and Ubiquitous Services, University of Science and Technology Beijing (USTB)", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150c913c"}, {"name": "ZhongShan Zhang", "org": "National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150d778a"}, {"name": "KePing Long", "org": "Beijing Engineering and Technology Research Center for Convergence Networks and Ubiquitous Services, University of Science and Technology Beijing (USTB)", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fb29ce"}], "title": "Optimal pilots design for frequency offsets and channel estimation in OFDM modulated single frequency networks", "keywords": ["channel estimation", "frequency offset estimation", "OFDM", "single frequency network", "synchronization"], "venue": "Science China Information Sciences", "year": 2014, "abstract": "Optimal pilot design and placement for both the frequency offsets and channel estimation in Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing modulated Single Frequency Network are treated. Unlike the conventional frequency-domain filter-based algorithms, the proposed pilot of each transmitter can always be demodulated at the receiver even if the received pilots of multiple transmitters are totally overlapped. Although the channel state information is needed in designing the proposed pilot for carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation, the performance of the proposed CFO estimation is robust to the channel estimation error. The optimal pilot as well as the Least-Squares (LS) channel estimator is also proposed, and the pilot for channel estimation is always a constant-modulus. A joint frequency offset and channel estimation scheme is also proposed, and the transmitters can adaptively optimize their pilots in the successive transmissions using the estimation results feedback in the former transmission. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of frequency offset and channel estimation accuracies. Since multiple copies of the same information can be received at each receiver, some combining technologies such as equal gain combining (EGC) or maximal ratio combining (MRC) can be applied at the receiver to improve the receiving diversity gain.

Purpose In this study, we aimed to explore the mutual transformation between polydatin and resveratrol in rats, and to compare the antioxidative effect of them in vivo. Study design In this study, we analyzed the serum molar concentration of polydatin and resveratrol after oral administration in rats and evaluated the anti-oxidative stress effects of them using a mouse model. Methods Rats were orally administered polydatin or resveratrol and the concentration of them in serum were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Their antioxidative effect was compared in mice with oxidative stress cardiomyopathy induced by doxorubicin (DOX). Results The results showed that polydatin and resveratrol could mutually transform in vivo, the molar concentration of polydatin in serum was always averagely 3.35 and 4.28 times as much as resveratrol after oral administration of polydatin and resveratrol at 200 mg/kg, respectively. Both polydatin and resveratrol could significantly decrease the content of malonydialdehyde (MDA), promote the activities of total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in plasma, and increase the content of glutathione (GSH) in myocardial tissue. The effect of polydatin surpassed resveratrol, particularly embodied in increasing the activities of T-SOD and CAT, and the content of GSH. Conclusion It illustrates that polydatin is the main substance in serum after intragastric administration with polydatin or resveratrol, and the mutual transformation between polydatin and resveratrol keeps balance; they both have the ability of antioxidative stress in vivo, and polydatin has a better effect than resveratrol, which hints that polydatin may be a substitute for resveratrol in antioxidant for clinical use.", "pid": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150e608f"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Yu-Liang Han", "org": "Shanghai Institute of Technology, School of Chemical and Environmental Engineering", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151be834"}, {"name": "Yao-Li Zhang", "org": "Shanghai Institute of Technology, School of Chemical and Environmental Engineering", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fa2422"}, {"name": "Yu-Hui Yang", "org": "Shanghai Institute of Technology, School of Chemical and Environmental Engineering", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15ff04a5"}, {"name": "Yu-Yu Huang", "org": "Shanghai Institute of Technology, School of Chemical and Environmental Engineering", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e15135890"}, {"name": "Xu Xu", "org": "Shanghai Institute of Technology, School of Chemical and Environmental Engineering", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151d69a9"}], "title": "Flexible device for direct analysis in real time without grid electrode for mass spectrometric analysis", "keywords": ["Device", "Direct analysis in real time", "Mass spectrometry"], "venue": "Fenxi Huaxue/ Chinese Journal of Analytical Chemistry", "year": 2015, "abstract": "A flexible and simple direct analysis in real-time (DART) device was developed without grid electrode for mass spectrometer injection.

Non-contact measurement method has been established to determine the sedimentation behaviors in a standard quartz tube for sedimentation, with internal diameter and height 23. mm and 215. mm, respectively, with controlled temperature and light intensity. As high performance camera has been equipped, the sedimentation images with high spatial and temporal resolution could be acquired, which can continuously capture sedimentation images with the resolution of 2048. \u00d7. 2048. pixel at a maximum rate of 60. slides/s. All the pictures were processed to extract the luminance matrix top-down along the fixed vertical midline of each picture, which implied sedimentation characteristics of the system at the moment the picture was taken. Combining all the luminance matrixes along vertical middle lines of the pictures, a time-luminance matrix profile was obtained. Digital image processing techniques were used to eliminate interference and establish a three-dimensional surface model of the sedimentation dynamics. Then, the derivative mutation algorithm has been developed for the intelligent identification of sedimentation interface with threshold optimization so as to quantitatively analyze the sedimentation dynamics with visualization. The sedimentation curve and sedimentation dynamic equation of the non-homogeneous system were finally outputted by numerical fitting.

Analysis and design procedures of each component are treated as a black box in scramjet system design. Components of scramjet are designed and optimized at subsystem level in the first step, and then a system level optimization is performed for the whole scramjet. Multi-fidelity simulation models are developed and applied to analyze and design the scramjet model. According to the requirement of design, appropriate fidelity simulation models are adopted in design cycle under the limitation of time and budget. A design and optimization example is presented in which some parameters are chosen as scramjet system level variables by sensitivity analysis of all possible design parameters; other parameters become component level variables of forebody/inlet, combustor and afterbody/nozzle.

Design process of scramjet must consider effects on whole hypersonic vehicle integrated performance. Flowpath of scramjet includes forebody and afterbody of vehicle. In vehicle flight process, high pressure of pre-compress coming air on forebody surface will produce pitch up moment, and high pressure of expanded gas on afterbody surface will produce pitch down moment In addition, internal surface of scramjet will produce pitch up or down moment more or less, such as dissymmetrical wall of combustor. For an operational hypersonic vehicle, approach of stability and control is deflection of tails. Too much degree deflection of tail will increase trim drag of vehicle and therefore design of scramjet flowpath should decrease effect on vehicle trim moment. This paper presents some further research work based on our previous research work that scramjet optimization design aimed at optimum propulsion performance (IAC-04-S.5.11). Effects of scramjet operation on hypersonic trim moment have been analyzed. In design process of multi-lever optimization aimed at trim drag keep minimum, optimization object of scramjet flowpath is determined and new design object consider propulsion performance and effect on vehicle trim moment. Results show new scramjet flowpath design has little effect on hypersonic vehicle trim moment than design just aimed at propulsion performance, and meanwhile overall trim drag of vehicle will be reduced.

One of the key components of FFSC engine is the main gas-gas injector, which would be a straightforward process without atomization and vaporization compared with liquid systems. However, not only does propellant mixing drive the performance level, it also has a significant impact on face cooling and injector durability. This paper focused on the investigation of influence of the gas-gas injector number on the engine performance. The fabricate cost will increase with the increase of the injector number, which will enhance the fabricate difficulty as to the same combustion chamber. Supposing the engine performance is the same, the fewer injector number is preferred. Three dimensional numerical simulation of FFSC combustion chamber with different injector numbers were conducted in this paper. In order to simplify the simulations, a concentric arrangement was selected as the uniform layout and a shear coaxial injector as the uniform configuration. A series of the injector numbers were chosen for simulation according to design guideline, such as 6, 18, 30, 48, 60, 90, and 216. The mixing efficiency of the combustion chamber was selected as engine performance parameter. The results of the investigation indicated that the mixing efficiency increased axially and with the increase of the injector number. The combustion efficiency of the 6-injectors layout combustion chamber varied slowly to reach the maximum unlike other layouts within a short distance from the injection face.

The thermal effects are produced by plume backflow impact, plume gas radiation, and engine surface radiation. The solving process consists of four steps. Firstly the N-S equations are solved by difference method to present the continuous flow field near the nozzle exit of orbit transfer engine. Secondly according to the distribution of Knudsen number, entrance boundary conditions of DSMC simulation particles are confirmed. Then the plume backflow field near the SRSS is calculated by DSMC method, as well as the impact thermal effects on the SRSS. Thirdly, according to the density distribution of plume flow field, effective gas radiation region is validated. Using the method of waveband integral and finite element, the gas radiation effects are solved. Finally, radiation effect of the orbit transfer engine and reflected radiation effect of the thermal baffle are obtained by analyzing the angle factors and visibility between SRSS and them. Since the orbit transfer engine of SINOSAT-2 is the same with that of DFH-3, the numerical simulation of the plume effects of the SRSS for the DFH-3 is also carried out. The study shows that, for both SINOSAT-2 and DFH-3, the solid radiation heat flux value of engine surface is the largest and must be paid more attention to, and there is a slightly thermal effect on the SRSS by the backflow of plume, while the thermal flux value is small, and the plume thermal radiation effect can be neglected. However, the heat flux value of SINOSAT-2 satellite is larger than that of the DFH-3. The research carried out in this paper can provide reference for the further temperature analysis and thermal protection of the SRSS for design departments. Copyright IAF/IAA.

The gas-portfire igniter/flame holder was placed downstream of the injector on the centerline at three different locations in order to find the best suitable gas-portfire injector geometrical configuration.

High enthalpy vitiated air is heated by the hydrogen-oxygen combustion at a total temperature of 1899K, entering the isolator entrance at a Mach number of 3.0. Two struts in the cross arrangement act as the main injectors, and a ramped-wall cavity, located downstream of the second strut, acts as the flameholder. The liquid kerosene acts as the fuel, and the whole fuel equivalence ratio is held constant to 1.0. The local fuel equivalence ratio at the first stage is varied from 0 to 0.7. Three-dimensional compressible, turbulent, reacting flow calculations with a single-step chemistry model are conducted using the FLUENT 12.1 code, which solves the Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) equations appropriate for calorically or thermally perfect gases with a cell-centered finite volume scheme. The Menter\u2019s SST k-w turbulence model is used in this work. The static pressure profiles along the combustor side wall in different cases are presented. The axial variations of the combustion efficiency and total pressure losses are also calculated to investigate the influence of fuel distribution on the combustor performance. The numerical results show that the shock train induced by the first strut improves the kerosene-air mixing. After pressurized by the shock train, the inflow reaches a high static temperature to ignite the kerosene. With the local fuel equivalence ratio at the first strut increasing, the combustion efficiency and net thrust increase, while the mass-averaged total pressure recoveries at the combustor exit are nearly held constant. When the local fuel equivalence ratio at the first strut exceeds a certain value, the pre-combustion shock train is pushed out of the isolator, resulting in an inlet unstart.

The time-averaged Nusselt number is scaled with Grashof number of power 0.21-0.24 and time duration for attaining a steady/quasi-steady state is also correlated to Grashof number. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier Ltd.", "pid": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1515562c"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Zi-Tao Yu", "org": "Institute of Thermal Science and Power Systems", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fb6e87"}, {"name": "Xu Xu", "org": "College of Metrological and Measurement Engineering", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1513cecc"}, {"name": "Ya-Cai Hu", "org": "Institute of Thermal Science and Power Systems", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151cf42b"}, {"name": "Li-Wu Fan", "org": "Mechanical Engineering Department", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ffdef1"}, {"name": "Ke-Fa Cen", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Clean Energy Utilization", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1502b221"}], "title": "Transient natural convective heat transfer of a low-Prandtl-number fluid inside a horizontal circular cylinder with an inner coaxial triangular cylinder", "keywords": ["Circular cylinder", "Heat transfer", "Low-Prandtl-number fluid", "Pitchfork bifurcation", "Transient natural convection", "Triangular cylinder"], "venue": "International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer", "year": 2010, "abstract": "A numerical study of transient natural convection of liquid gallium (Pr = 0.023) from a horizontal triangular cylinder to its coaxial cylindrical enclosure is performed.

Quenching curves were acquired directly and boiling curves during the quenching processes were calculated based on a lumped capacitance model. It is shown that increase in both concentration of suspensions and surface roughness expedites quenching speed and enhances critical heat flux. Increase in surface roughness decreases the time duration of nucleate boiling and less film boiling time is primarily due to increased concentration. The combined effects of surface roughness and concentration suggest that quenching objects are utilized with rough surfaces in nanoparticle suspensions of relatively high concentration so as to significantly shorten the quenching time for engineering applications. \u00a9 All Rights Reserved.", "pid": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e151932b7"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Dongyang Xu", "org": "Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1515e1d6"}, {"name": "Lei Huang", "org": "Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e15135274"}, {"name": "Xu Xu", "org": "Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1513cecc"}, {"name": "Zhongfu Ye", "org": "Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fb930f"}], "title": "Widely linear MVDR beamformers for noncircular signals based on time-averaged second-order noncircularity coefficient estimation", "keywords": ["Cyclic", "frequency offset estimation", "minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer", "noncircular", "rectilinear signal", "widely linear (WL)"], "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology", "year": 2013, "abstract": "The optimal widely linear (WL) minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer, which has a powerful performance for the reception of a noncircular signal, was proposed by Chevalier in 2009.

The melting rates and local heat transfer along the heated bottom were compared quantitatively based on the variations of the instantaneous liquid fraction and average Nusselt number over the bottom during melting, respectively. It was shown that at a given size of the cavity, melting was expedited as more CNTs were introduced. The expediting of melting was mainly attributed to the enhanced thermal conductivity and lowering of latent heat of fusion of NEPCM. The inclusion of CNTs, however, increases considerably the viscosity of melted NEPCM, which in turn leads to less significant natural convection effect during melting. As a result, increase of loading of CNTs was shown to lead to two competing effects. The feasibility of NEPCM in melting is justified when the enhanced heat conduction overweighs the suppressed natural convection.

Attention has been paid primarily to the enhanced thermal conductivity of the suspensions that depends significantly on the material, size, shape, dispersion and loading of the nanoparticles. In this paper, the effects of adding silver (Ag) nanoparticles of various sizes and shapes on the thermal conductivity of ethylene glycol (EG)-based suspensions were investigated experimentally. These included Ag nanospheres (Ag NSs), Ag nanowires (Ag NWs) and Ag nanoflakes (Ag NFs). The suspensions were prepared at concentrations of 1, 5 and 10 mg/mL. The size and shape of the various Ag nanoparticles were observed by means of microscopy techniques. The dispersion and stability of the suspensions were also inspected. Measurements of the thermal conductivity of the suspensions were performed on a Hot Disk Thermal Constants Analyzer, which is based on the transient plane source technique, at elevated temperatures from 10 to 30 \u00b0C at an increment of 5 \u00b0C. It was shown that the thermal conductivity of the EG-based suspensions increases with raising the temperature. The Ag NWs of a very high aspect ratio (~400) caused greatest relative enhancement up to 15.6% at the highest loading of 10 mg/mL (~0.1 vol.%). The other two types of nanoparticles, Ag NSs and Ag NFs with much smaller aspect ratios, only led to enhancements up to 5%. The formation of a network of Ag NWs that facilitates heat conduction was likely responsible for their better performance. In addition, the relative enhancement was predicted by the Hamilton-Crosser (H-C) equation that takes the shape effect of the particles into consideration. It was shown that the predictions far underestimate the thermal conductivity enhancements but are qualitatively consistent with their shape dependence.

The effects of GONs deposited on the boiling surface were compared among three representative cases. With the deposition of GONs during the transition boiling phase, the quenching period of the suspension was shortened by 10 s as compared to that of deionized water, while the critical heat flux (CHF) was improved by 10% and the contact angle was reduced from 104\u00b0 to 78\u00b0. After subsequent quenching of the boiling surface with GON deposition in deionized water, the contact angle was increased to 89\u00b0 and the CHF was somewhat deteriorated. It was concluded that the enhancement of CHF is primarily resulted from surface deposition of GONs. The quenching speed and the heat transfer rate during the transition boiling phase are also affected by the dynamic deposition process and the suspended GONs. \u00a9 All Rights Reserved.", "pid": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e15209299"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Xu Xu", "org": "School of Information Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1513cecc"}, {"name": "Yi Zhang", "org": "School of Information Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151a5331"}, {"name": "Zhongfu Ye", "org": "School of Information Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fb930f"}, {"name": "Ming Bao", "org": "Institute of Acoustics", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150dadda"}], "title": "Direction finding based on single channel array", "keywords": ["Direction finding", "Single channel receiver", "Sparse recovery", "Sparse representation"], "venue": "Proceedings of the 2013 6th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing, CISP 2013", "year": 2013, "abstract": "A new method of direction finding based on the single channel array is proposed in this paper.

The goal of SCSS is to separate the underlying clean speeches from a signal mixture, which was often achieved by learning a pair of discriminative sub-dictionaries and sparsely coding the mixture speech signal over the dictionary pair. The case of 2 source speech signals is considered in this paper. Unfortunately, the existing DL approaches cannot avoid the source confusion drastically, i.e., when we sparsely represent the mixture signal over the dictionary pair, parts of the object speech component are explained by interferer speech dictionary atoms and vice-versa. In order to suppress more source confusion, we divide the training sets into two layers of components and learn hierarchical sub-dictionaries using different layers. Experimental testing is shown to verify the superior performance compared with other existing approaches. \u00a9 2014 IEEE.", "pid": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1501f409"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Eric Li", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Advanced Design and Manufacturing for Vehicle Body, Hunan University", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fb9a60"}, {"name": "Z.C.

However, the extreme condition of the reconstruction-based technique, that the precise information about the array structure is known in advance, is almost impossible in practice. In this paper, a novel method to reconstruct the interference-plus-noise covariance matrix is proposed. Considering the imprecise prior information about the array structure, which means that the array may be uncalibrated, we use an annulus uncertainty set to constrain the steering vectors of the interferences. Then we integrate the Capon spectrum over the surface of the annulus, by which we can obtain the reconstructed interference matrix without containing the SOI. Since the integral interval is a high-dimensional domain, which is very difficult to solve, we use a discrete sum method to calculate the integral approximately. With the reconstructed interference-plus-noise matrix, the nominal steering vector can be corrected via maximizing the beamformer output power by solving a quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem.

Of particular importance in tumor growth and invasion, is the synthesis of complex N-linked oligosaccharides containing poly-N-acetyllactosamine (polylactosamine) chains, which have previously been reported to inhibit 3'-azidothymidine (AZT). Cluster of differentiation 147 (CD147) is a glycoprotein that carries \u03b21,6-branched polylactosamine sugars on its N-glycans. The present study aimed to explore the mechanism by which AZT may affect matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2) expression and the cell cycle via regulation of the N-glycans on CD147 in SGC-7901 and U251 cell lines. Subsequent to treatment with various concentrations of AZT, the N-glycans of highly glycosylated (HG)-CD147 were observed to decrease in the two cell lines, and the expression of MMP2 was also significantly decreased. In addition, cell cycle analysis demonstrated that the percentage of the cells in the G1 phase increased in a dose-dependent manner with AZT treatment, indicating that AZT may inhibit cell proliferation in SGC-7901 cells. It was suggested that AZT may reduce the biosynthesis of polylactosamine chains on CD147 and reduce MMP2 expression to inhibit cell proliferation in SGC-7901 and U251 cells. Thus, AZT is suggested to be an antineoplastic drug, which may be effective therapeutically for certain types of cancer through acting on the N-glycans of HG-CD147.", "pid": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15026c19"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Yu-fei Wang", "org": "Institute of Thermal Science and Power Systems, Department of Energy Engineering, Zhejiang University", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150ab57f"}, {"name": "Xu Xu", "org": "College of Metrological and Measurement Engineering, China Jiliang University", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1513cecc"}, {"name": "Tian Tian", "org": "Department of Mechanical, Materials, and Aerospace Engineering, University of Central Florida", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150f6903"}, {"name": "Li-wu Fan", "org": "Institute of Thermal Science and Power Systems, Department of Energy Engineering, Zhejiang University", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ffdef1"}, {"name": "Wen-long Wang", "org": "College of Metrological and Measurement Engineering, China Jiliang University", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f714c5"}, {"name": "Zi-tao Yu", "org": "Institute of Thermal Science and Power Systems, Department of Energy Engineering, Zhejiang University", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fb6e87"}], "title": "Laminar mixed convection heat transfer of SiC-EG nanofluids in a triangular enclosure with a rotating inner cylinder: simulations based on the measured thermal conductivity and viscosity", "keywords": ["Ethylene glycol-silicon carbide (SiC-EG) nanofluids", "Mixed convection", "Rayleigh number", "Rotating cylinder", "Triangular enclosure"], "venue": "Journal of Zhejiang University: Science A", "year": 2015, "abstract": "A numerical study has been carried out for a laminar steady mixed convection flow in a 2D triangular enclosure with an inner rotating coaxial cylinder, with the enclosure filled with ethylene glycol-silicon carbide (SiC-EG).

When the inlet gas swirl number increases, the maximum pressure location moves to the plenum chamber edge due to centrifugal force, and the minimum pressure location moves much closer to the axis. The difference between the maximum and minimum pressure increases with swirl number. The large pressure difference in the radial direction constricts the arc and leads to large current density and Ohm heating near the axis. This causes much higher temperature near the cathode. It is indicated that swirl gas accelerates cathode erosion for two reasons: increasing plenum chamber pressure and changing flow patterns in the vicinity of the cathode. It is also found that the gas with large swirl number leads the swirl velocity component to be larger at the cutting location according to angular momentum conservation. It has been suggested that this causes different bevel angles for the left and right edges of the cutting kerf. \u00a9 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.", "pid": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e1521040f"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Shuyu Zhang", "org": "Institute of Modern Physics", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f75470"}, {"name": "Xu Xu", "org": "Institute of Modern Physics", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e150255e6"}, {"name": "Rongqing Liang", "org": "Department of Illuminating Engineering and Light Sources", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1506c006"}, {"name": "Kefu Liu", "org": "Department of Illuminating Engineering and Light Sources", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151edf90"}], "title": "The influence of high negative substrate pulse bias on bulk plasma density", "venue": "2008 17th International Conference on High Power Particle Beams, BEAMS'08", "year": 2008, "abstract": "In this paper, we have used a dual Langmuir probe system to locate the edge of sheath and studied the influence of high negative pulse bias on bulk plasma density.

Previous studies have noted the correlation between growth of off-farm jobs and rental-market development at the aggregate level, but failed empirically to demonstrate mechanisms at the disaggregate level. Our analyses find concrete evidence at the household level connecting developments in labour and land markets. Growth in off-farm jobs allow rural households to transfer labour out of farming and prompt them to relinquish land rights, generating a supply of land that drives rental activities. We also go beyond interactions between factor markets and examine how local institution building promotes rental-market development. Institutions that either lower transaction costs or secure property rights are found to be crucial in explaining cross-regional variations in rental-market development. Finally, the rise of land rental markets also highlights the role of collective ownership in shaping rural development trajectory. \u00a9 The China Quarterly, 2004.", "pid":

(F9+, Ne9+, Si9+, S9+, Ar9+, and Ca9+) and q=11 (Si11+, Ar11+, and Ca11+) with helium at the same velocities were investigated. The cross-section ratios of the double-electron transfer (DET) to the single-electron capture (SEC) \u03c3DET \u03c3SEC and the true double-electron capture (TDC) to the double-electron transfer \u03c3TDC \u03c3DET were measured. It shows that for different ions in an isocharged sequence, the experimental cross-section ratio \u03c3DET \u03c3SEC varies by a factor of 3. The results confirm that the projectile core is another dominant factor besides the charge state and the collision velocity in slow (0.35-0.49 v0; v0 denotes the Bohr velocity) highly charged ions (HCIs) with helium collisions. The experimental cross-section ratio \u03c3DET \u03c3SEC is compared with the extended classical over-barrier model (ECBM), the molecular Coulombic barrier model (MCBM), and the semiempirical scaling laws (SSL). It also shows that the projectile core properties affect the initial capture probabilities as well as the subsequent relaxation of the projectiles. The experimental cross-section ratio \u03c3TDC \u03c3DET for those lower isocharged sequences is dramatically affected by the projectile core structure, while for those sufficiently highly isocharged sequences, the autoionization always dominates, hence the cross-section ratio \u03c3TDC \u03c3DET is always small. \u00a9 2007 The American Physical Society.", "pid": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1515aa73"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Li Wang", "org": "Department of Physics", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150aed30"}, {"name": "Xiao-An Zhang", "org": "Institute of Modern Physics", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f89283"}, {"name": "Zhi-Hu Yang", "org": "Institute of Modern Physics", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fb324c"}, {"name": "Xi-Meng Chen", "org": "Department of Modern Physics", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f8d39b"}, {"name": "Hong-Qiang Zhang", "org": "Department of Modern Physics", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f999bd"}, {"name": "Ying Cui", "org": "Department of Modern Physics", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1513e398"}, {"name": "Jian-Xiong Shao", "org": "Department of Modern Physics", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fcdff8"}, {"name": "Xu Xu", "org": "Department of Modern Physics", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e150450c6"}], "title": "Coulomb potential energy effect on the intensity of the characteristic lines at highly charged ion incidence on Al surface", "keywords": ["Characteristic lines", "Coulomb potential energy", "Highly charged ion", "Spectra intensity"], "venue": "Wuli Xuebao/Acta Physica Sinica", "year": 2008, "abstract": "The Al atomic characteristic spectral lines were induced by the impact of ", "pid": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e1520f1cd"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Ying Cui", "org": "Department of Modern Physics", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1513e398"}, {"name": "Shengsheng Yang", "org": "National Key Laboratory of Vacuum and Cryogenics Technology and Physics", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fe02ed"}, {"name": "Zhihu Yang", "org": "Institute of Modern Physics", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fb324c"}, {"name": "Jinzhang Xu", "org": "Department of Modern Physics", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15015e9d"}, {"name": "Hongqiang Zhang", "org": "Department of Modern Physics", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f999bd"}, {"name": "Xu Xu", "org": "Department of Modern Physics", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e150450c6"}, {"name": "Jianxiong Shao", "org": "Department of Modern Physics", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fcdff8"}, {"name": "Zhaoyuan Liu", "org": "Department of Modern Physics", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1503325d"}, {"name": "Guoqing Xiao", "org": "Institute of Modern Physics", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e1510a4e8"}, {"name": "Xiaoan Zhang", "org": "Normal College of Xianyang", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f89283"}, {"name": "Yongtao Zhao", "org": "Institute of Modern Physics", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15111548"}, {"name": "Yanping Zhang", "org": "Institute of Modern Physics", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e150466e6"}, {"name": "Ximeng Chen", "org": "Department of Modern Physics", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150bcb66"}], "title": "Kinetic energy and charge state effects in the X-ray emission of Mo surface induced by Xeq+ (q = 25, 29) ions", "keywords": ["Kinetic energy and charge state effect", "Surface", "X-ray", "Xeq+"], "venue": "Science in China, Series G: Physics, Mechanics and Astronomy", "year": 2008, "abstract": "L-shell X-ray spectra of Mo surface induced by Xe", "pid": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150c8d1a"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Juan Sun", "org": "Department of Pharmaceutical and Biological Engineering", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1514d125"}, {"name": "Xianqiu Lan", "org": "Department of Pharmaceutical and Biological Engineering", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e151fd433"}, {"name": "Xiaohai Tang", "org": "Chengdu Pharmmate Technology Co. ,Ltd.", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e150005f8"}, {"name": "Xu Xu", "org": "Department of Pharmaceutical and Biological Engineering", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1502aefa"}, {"name": "Hang Song", "org": "Department of Pharmaceutical and Biological Engineering", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fdf890"}], "title": "Enantiomer separation of phenlypropanol using amide type chiral stationary phases", "keywords": ["Chiral stationary phase", "Enantioseparation", "High performance liquid chromatography/polarimetry", "Phenlypropanol"], "venue": "Fenxi Huaxue/ Chinese Journal of Analytical Chemistry", "year": 2006, "abstract": "The direct enantiomer separation of phenlpropanol on three Pirlk types of chiral column Whelk-O 1, DNB-Leu, DNB-Pg had been studied.

Safety evaluation of the microgels was conducted by maximal tolerance dose (MTD) method. 5-Aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) was loaded into the blank microgels, and the in vitro drug release behavior was also studied. The ulcerative colitis mice model was established using dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) as inducing agent. The 5-ASA/microgels were used to treat the ulcerative colitis mice, and free 5-ASA was used as positive control. On the 7th day, the mice were killed and the therapeutic effects of each groups were investigated. We could see that 5-ASA had good efficacy for treating ulcerative colitis and microgels entrapping 5-ASA could significantly enhance the colon-targeting to improve its efficacy.

On the other hand, eyes, as a special organ in the human body, have unique advantages to be used for testing new biomedical research and development, such as drug delivery. Intraocular biocompatible studies on graphene-related materials are thus essential. Here, we report our recent studies on intraocular biocompatibility and cytotoxicity of graphene oxide (GO) both in vitro and in vivo. The successful preparation of GO nanosheets was confirmed using atomic force microscopy, contact angle analyzer, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. The influence of GO on human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells in terms of the cell morphology, viability, membrane integrity, and apoptosis was investigated using various techniques, including optical micrography, cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay, and apoptosis assay. The addition of GO had little influence on cell morphology, but the change was visible after long-time culturing. RPE cells showed higher than 60% cell viability by CCK-8 assay in GO solutions and less than 8% LDH release, although a small amount of apoptosis (1.5%) was observed. In vitro results suggested good biocompatibility of GO to RPE cells with slight adverse influence, on the cell viability and morphology in long-time periods, along with aggregation of GO. Thus, some further studies are needed to clarify the cytotoxicity mechanism of GO. GO intravitreally injected eyes showed few changes in eyeball appearance, intraocular pressure (IOP), eyesight, and histological photos. Our results suggested that GO did not cause any significant toxicity to the cell growth and proliferation. Intravitreal injection of GO into rabbits' eyes did not lead to much change in the eyeball appearance, IOP, electroretinogram, and histological examination. \u00a9 2012 American Chemical Society.", "pid": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15129974"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Dong-Yu Song", "org": "Department of Ophthalmology", "id": "5b5433e3e1cd8e4e15f46e0a"}, {"name": "Ming-Hong Gao", "org": "Department of Ophthalmology", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f70d47"}, {"name": "Xu Xu", "org": "Department of Ophthalmology", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150efffa"}, {"name": "Jing Yu", "org": "Department of Ophthalmology", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e150396a6"}, {"name": "Hai Yu", "org": "Department of Ophthalmology", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fbf362"}, {"name": "Ying-Xin Chen", "org": "Department of Ophthalmology", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e15078d86"}, {"name": "Xiao-Guang Zhang", "org": "Department of Ophthalmology", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150eaa61"}], "title": "Expression of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 in alkali-burned cornea of conjunctival flap covering", "keywords": ["Alkali-burned cornea", "Conjunctival flap", "Matrix metalloproteinase-9", "Tissue inhibitor metallo-proteinase-1"], "venue": "International Eye Science", "year": 2012, "abstract": "AIM: To study the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and tissue inhibitor metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) after conjunctival flap covering in alkali-burned cornea.

METHODS: It was a retrospective case series study. Sixteen patients (19 eyes) with rheumatic diseases associated corneal melting underwent surgery for tectonic indications at the General Hospital of Shenyang Military Region between January 2008 and August 2012 were involved. The selection of surgical procedures was based on the preoperative corneal status (location, depth and area). These include penetrating keratoplasty (4 eyes), deep lamellar keratoplasty (8 eyes), corneal (scleral) patch grafts (5 eyes) and amniotic membrane transplantation (5 eyes). Concomitant systemic disease, indication for tectonic graft, preoperative visual acuity, postoperative visual acuity and postoperative complications were recorded and studied during the follow-up period of 1 year. Efficacy was evaluated by the outcomes of cured or improved or invalid. RESULTS: Corneal melting were completely cured in 12 eyes, improved in 5 eyes and showed invalid in 2 eyes. Visual acuity in 7 eyes (36.8%) was improved after operation. Postoperative complications included graft melting in 3 eyes, persistent corneal epithelium defect in 3 eyes, secondary glaucoma in 1 eye, complicated cataract in 1 eye. CONCLUSION: Designing the appropriate type of tectonic surgery based on the different preoperative corneal status allows the removal of the corneal lesion and spares the maximum amount of normal tissue. It is an effective approach for preservation of eyeballs and restoration of visual function.

Theoretically, this research extends agency theory into the study of the efficiency of IPOs and further the relation among founders, VCs and efficiency of IPOs. The results suggest that there is an entrenchment between founders' ownership and efficiency, and this entrenchment looks like a curvilinear (handstand U-shaped) between founders' retained equity and efficiency, which demonstrates that number of shares founder owners plays an important role in the efficiency of IPOs by signaling effect. Yet, there is no significant evidence statistically supports that the founder-CEO has a positive influence on the efficiency of IPOs, the reason of which might be investors' concern about the moral hazard that founders cash out their shares.

There is a great need to develop a computational method for fast and reliable prediction of the locations of proteins according to their primary sequences. In this paper, we used the composite classifier system that was formed by a set of k-nearest neighbor (K-NN) classifiers, each of which was defined in a different pseudo amino composition vector. In the pseudo amino composition vector space, protein can be presented by Pseudo amino acid composition. The location of a queried protein is determined by the outcome of choice made among these constituent individual classifiers. It is shown through the outcome that the classifier outperformed the single classifier widely used in biological literature. So the composite classifier can be employed as a robust method to predict protein location in the field of biological data mining. \u00a9 2011 Academic Journals.", "pid": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e15177b6e"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Jie Lin", "org": "School of Economics and Management, Tongji University", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e15181367"}, {"name": "Xu Xu", "org": "Business School, University of Queensland", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1503a6c2"}, {"name": "Dongming Xu", "org": "Business School, University of Queensland", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15123d8e"}], "title": "Strategic supplier selection: A domain driven data mining methodology", "keywords": ["Analytic hierarchy process", "Association rule algorithm", "Domain driven data mining", "Optimization", "Set theory", "Supplier selection"], "venue": "Information (Japan)", "year": 2010, "abstract": "The fierce competitions in supply chain are changing the conventional buyer-seller relationship, which leads to undermine business strengths. To respond this transformation, strategic partnership has been gaining increasing attention.

This paper proposes a two-phase Domain Driven Data Mining (DDDM) methodology for strategic supplier selection. Phase one is termed domain knowledge acquisition and analysis, while phase two is supplier set optimization. Meanwhile, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), set theory and association rule mining are included in the two phases. Furthermore, a case study is conducted to demonstrate the proposed supplier selection model. Simulation results indicate that it is more efficient than single AHP or association rule algorithm. In short, the proposed model employs both qualitative subjective judgments and quantitative objective data to select strategic suppliers.

The MODIS image we used was taken in the same period as the time of filed sampling. The MODIS-NDVI and EVI values of field samples were extracted from MODIS image. The optimal regression equation was developed between the NDVI values and the vegetation cover of field samples in grassland, shrub and forest respectively. The similar process was conducted for EVI values. The simulation precision of the equation was tested by independent field data. Lastly, the predictive validity of natural vegetation cover by using NDVI and EVI values was compared and assessed. The results show that all selected optimal regression equation pass significance testing of 0.05. As for forest, shrub and grassland, the coefficient Correlation (R2) of selected optimal regression equations based on NDVI values is higher than that based on EVI(from 0.488 to 0.644), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) based on NDVI values is lower (from 0.0617 to 0.0916) than that based on EVI values.

Methods: Trypsin dispersion method was used to isolate cells from human umbilical cord and placenta. The tissues from umbilial cord and placenta were cyropreserved with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) in different concentrations. Then the percentage of living cells in thawed tissues, and their micro-structure were observed and compared with fresh tissues under transmission electron microscope. The expression of cell immune phenotype before and after cyropreservation were detected with immuno-histochemistry method. Results: The percentage of living cells in human fresh umbilial cord was 67.0%, while that in cyropreserved umbilical cord was 23.4%, 55.5%, 48.8%, 31.8%, respectively in 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% of DMSO. The percentage of living cells in cyropreserved tissues was similar to that of fresh tissues when the volume percentage of DMSO was 10% (P > 0.05), and it was significantly different with that when volume percentage of DMSO was 5% and 20% (P < 0.01). The result by transmission electron microscope was coincident with the results shown above. The results were similar between placenta and umbilical cord.

The glycosphingolipid was extracted from freshly hatched brine shrimp by Folch's partition, followed by mild alkaline hydrolysis and purification with a Sep-Pak plus silica cartridge. The structure of brine shrimp glycosphingolipid was determined by gas chromatography, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, fast-atom bombardment mass spectrometry, and 1 >H-NMR spectrometry to be GlcNAc\u03b11-2Fuc\u03b11-3Man\u03b21-4Glc\u03b21- 1\u2032Cer.

Supplementation with adequate amount of selenium is very important for human health. As various selenium compounds have different biological effects, preparation and functional study of new product are essential for the discovery of selenium-containing drug. In this work, polymannuronate(PM) was used as the raw material to synthesize sulfonated polymannuronate(S-PM). Seleno-polymannuronate(Se-PM) was then prepared by the replacement of sulfonated group in S-PM with sodium selenite. The yield of Se-PM synthesis was 54% with a selenium content of 437.25 \u03bcg/g. Purified Se-PM was used to study its antioxidative property and effect on Alzheimer's disease(AD), using N2a-APP695-sw cells as an AD model. Cell viability was detected by CCK-8 assay. Intracellular reactive oxygen species(ROS) was measured by flow cytometry. Mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome C release were detected by laser scanning confocal microscope. The expression levels of cell apoptosis and AD pathology relevant proteins were analyzed by Western Blot. The results showed that the optimum selenium concentration was 2.5 \u03bcmol/L for Se-PM to significantly increase cell viability. Se-PM at this concentration could prevent cells from the oxidative damage of hydrogen peroxide, inhibit intracellular ROS, increase the activity of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, promote mitochondrial membrane potential, and suppress cytochrome C release into cytoplasm. Meanwhile, Se-PM could also increase Bcl-2 expression and decrease Bax expression, inhibit the expression of AD pathology relevant proteins BACE1 and APP. Those results indicated that Se-PM could resist AD through the prevention of cell apoptosis and amyloid plaque formation, a key pathological feature of AD.

As AD is closely related with aging, and its pathology is caused by multiple factors, its pathogenesis is bound to be multiple and intricate. Besides, the loss of neurons cannot be regenerated, which suggests that early prediction and intervention in AD treatment is very important. This paper stresses the urgency in developing early diagnosis methods, including positron emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and sensitive AD biomarkers from blood and urine. The drugs for AD prevention and treatment are generally divided into six types: first-line drugs, vaccines, drugs in the research stage, adjuvant therapy drugs, traditional Chinese medicines, and health products (also known as Medical food). As the top three types have not yet make a breakthrough in AD treatment over a long period of time, people recently turned to pay close attention to the application and mechanism of the other three types of drugs for delaying AD progression. Research in our lab focuses on the effect and mechanism of the latter three types of drugs, and preliminary results show that selenomethionine, coenzyme Q-10, and icariin can significantly prevent AD progression. This paper evaluates the situation and challenge the anti-AD drugs are facing and proposes a change in the strategy for AD prevention: Single-target treatments should be abandoned, and multiple-target idea and inter-related systematic biology should be adopted for studying AD mechanisms and developing new drugs.", "pid": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f6e8b3"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Xu Xu", "org": "College of Life Science, Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Marine Bioresources and Ecology, Shenzhen University", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f67f94"}, {"name": "Xiaoting Wu", "org": "College of Life Science, Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Marine Bioresources and Ecology, Shenzhen University", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e15203123"}, {"name": "Qingqing Wang", "org": "College of Life Science, Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Microbial Genetic Engineering, Shenzhen University", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f6b915"}, {"name": "Nan Cai", "org": "College of Life Science, Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Marine Bioresources and Ecology, Shenzhen University", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e150611bf"}, {"name": "Hanxue Zhang", "org": "College of Life Science, Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Marine Bioresources and Ecology, Shenzhen University", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150ac3cb"}, {"name": "Zedong Jiang", "org": "Division of Biochemistry, Faculty of Fisheries, Nagasaki University", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e1519f342"}, {"name": "Min Wan", "org": "Division of Physiological Chemistry 2, Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institute", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e1519d53c"}, {"name": "Tatsuya Oda", "org": "Division of Biochemistry, Faculty of Fisheries, Nagasaki University", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f9b339"}], "title": "Immunomodulatory effects of alginate oligosaccharides on murine macrophage RAW264.7 cells and their structure-activity relationships", "keywords": ["guluronate oligosaccharide", "macrophage activation", "mannuronate oligosaccharide", "MAP kinase", "NF-\u03baB", "nitric oxide", "ROS", "TNF-\u03b1"], "venue": "Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry", "year": 2014, "abstract": "This study evaluated the immunomodulatory activities, including regulation of nitric oxide (NO), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 production in RAW264.7 murine macrophages, of alginate oligosaccharides (AOS) and investigated their structure-activity relationships.

Herein, we sought to elucidate possible effects of alginate-derived polyguluronate (PG) and unsaturated guluronate oligosaccharide (GOS) on antibacterial activities of macrophages. Our results showed that, in contrast to PG, GOS markedly increased the phagocytosis of IgG-opsonized Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus and further inhibited the survival of intracellular bacteria in macrophages. In line with this, GOS treatment resulted in the enhanced expression of Fc\u03b3 receptors on macrophages. In addition, GOS activated NF-\u03baB pathway, induced TNF-\u03b1 secretion, and elevated the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and the production of nitric oxide. Meanwhile, GOS stimulated the production of reactive oxygen species in macrophages. Moreover, guluronate trimer to hexamer (G3-G6) in GOS exhibited significant activity that increased the bacterial phagocytosis of macrophages, with the pentamer (G5), displaying the highest activity. Finally, our in vivo results further confirmed that GOS but not PG significantly improved bacterial clearance in murine acute peritonitis. In conclusion, GOS enhances antibacterial activities of macrophages via modulating signaling pathways related to innate immunity, suggesting that GOS might be a promising therapeutic candidate to improve the host defense against bacterial infection. \u00a9 FASEB.", "pid": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15033725"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Rui Zhou", "org": "College of Life Science, Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Marine Bioresources and Ecology, Shenzhen University", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e15184ec5"}, {"name": "Xuyang Shi", "org": "College of Life Science, Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Microbial Genetic Engineering, Shenzhen University", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151c3130"}, {"name": "Yan Gao", "org": "National Oceanographic Center of Qingdao", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151c4513"}, {"name": "Nan Cai", "org": "College of Life Science, Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Marine Bioresources and Ecology, Shenzhen University", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e150611bf"}, {"name": "Zedong Jiang", "org": "Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Food Microbiology and Enzyme Engineering", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150b5ef2"}, {"name": "Xu Xu", "org": "College of Life Science, Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Marine Bioresources and Ecology, Shenzhen University", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f67f94"}], "title": "Anti-inflammatory activity of guluronate oligosaccharides obtained by oxidative degradation from alginate in lipopolysaccharide-activated murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cells", "keywords": ["alginate oligosaccharides", "lipopolysaccharide", "mitogen-activated protein kinases", "nuclear factor-\u03baB", "Toll-like receptor 4"], "venue": "Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry", "year": 2015, "abstract": "Alginate has notably diverse pharmacological activities.

In large-scale irrigation districts, the application of water-saving practices, e.g., improving the canal system, using water-saving irrigation technology and adjusting cropping patterns, is required for the sustainable agricultural development and the river basin environmental equilibrium. Adopting water-saving practices leads to lowering the groundwater table and to controlling salinity impacts related to excessive irrigation. However, assessing the effects of water-saving practices on the groundwater system requires further investigation. The Jiefangzha Irrigation Scheme of the Hetao Irrigation District is used as a case study for analyzing the temporal and spatial dynamics of the groundwater table. A lumped parameter groundwater balance model has been developed with this purpose and to assess impacts of various water-saving practices. The model was calibrated with monthly datasets relative to the non-frozen periods of 1997-1999 and validated with datasets from 2000 to 2002. Results indicate that canal seepage and deep percolation account for respectively 48% and 44% of the annual groundwater recharge. Groundwater discharge by direct evaporation and plant roots uptake represents 82% of the total annual groundwater discharge. After validation, the model was applied to assess the impacts of various canal and farm irrigation water-saving practices. It was observed that improvements in the canal system (e.g., canal lining, upgrading the hydraulic regulation and control structures, improving delivery schedules) might lower the groundwater table by 0.28-0.48. m, depending upon the level of implementation of these measures. Higher declines of the groundwater table are predicted when water-saving technologies are applied at both the canal and the farm systems. That decline of the water table favours salinity control and reduces capillary rise, thus reducing the groundwater evaporation and uptake by plant roots; that reduction may attain 128. mm. However, predictions may change depending on the way how water-saving measures are applied, which may be different of assumptions made; therefore, there is the need to perform a follow-up of the interventions in order to update predictions. Results indicate the need for appropriate research leading to improved irrigation management when the decline of the groundwater level will reduce groundwater contribution to vegetation growth. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier B.V.", "pid": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15013af1"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Xu Xu", "org": "Center for Agricultural Water Research", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151f40c7"}, {"name": "Guanhua Huang", "org": "Center for Agricultural Water Research", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15038143"}, {"name": "Zhongyi Qu", "org": "College of Water Conservancy and Civil Engineering", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150d92a5"}, {"name": "Luis S.

The hydrologic processes are highly interactive between the vadose zone and groundwater under shallow water table conditions.

However, the recharge and evapotranspiration are observed to vary with topography, soil type, land use, and water management practices. Additionally, they are known to vary temporally and spatially and are difficult to estimate, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. Thus, it is important to devise an appropriate method to estimate the recharge and evapotranspiration fluxes in groundwater modeling. In this study, a Soil-Water-Atmosphere-Plant (SWAP) package was integrated into a groundwater flow model (MODFLOW) in such a way that the SWAP package calculates vertical flux for MODFLOW, while MODFLOW provides averaged water table depth to determine the bottom boundary condition for SWAP zones. The SWAP zones in MODFLOW are derived from a combination of topology, soil type, land use, water management practices using geographic information systems (GIS). Then the MODFLOW with SWAP package was tested using a two-dimensional saturated-unsaturated water table recharge experiment. Results showed that the simulated water table elevations matched well with the observed ones except at the early period during which they were slightly higher than the observed ones, probably due to neglecting lateral diffusion in the unsaturated zone.

In view of understanding the related processes in Qingtongxia Irrigation District, the physically based agro-hydrological model, SWAP, was adopted to explore the response of soil water and solute dynamics, and crop yield to water table changes. With this purpose, SWAP was modified through the inclusion of a simplified crop growth module, a method of variable active-nodes, and a nonlinear osmotic head-dependent function for a better description of the effects of salinity stress on root water uptake. The model was calibrated and validated using wheat's experimental data from 2007 and 2008. Simulations of soil water content, salinity concentration, biomass, and crop yield fitted well with field observations. The calibrated model was then used to predict changes in crop yield, soil water dynamics and soil salinity considering scenarios with different groundwater depths and irrigation strategies. The present irrigation strategy favors salt leaching even when considering the increase of water table depth that results in small crop yield reduction (<6%) due to salt stress. The 80% and 60% reduced irrigation strategies led to increased soil salinity and, eventually, crop yield reductions of 6-14% and 13-21%, respectively, when the depth of the water table increased.

Analysis of the target scenario simulation indicated that the improvement of water conveyance and irrigation scheduling could lead to a 30% reduction of deep percolation, and save 15% of irrigation water without negative effects on crop yields.", "pid": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e150009ad"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Yuanyuan Hao", "org": "Chinese-Israeli International Center for Research and Training in Agriculture", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e15043baa"}, {"name": "Xu Xu", "org": "Chinese-Israeli International Center for Research and Training in Agriculture", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151f40c7"}, {"name": "Quanzhong Huang", "org": "Chinese-Israeli International Center for Research and Training in Agriculture", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ffdaad"}, {"name": "Guanhua Huang", "org": "Chinese-Israeli International Center for Research and Training in Agriculture", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15038143"}], "title": "Modeling soil water-salt dynamics and maize yield responses to groundwater depths and irrigations", "keywords": ["Capillary rising", "Crop growth", "Crops", "Groundwater irrigation", "Growth", "HYDRUS-1D", "Soils", "Yinbei Irrigation District"], "venue": "Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering", "year": 2014, "abstract": "Reduction of water diversion from the Yellow River will intensify water shortage problems in the Yinbei Irrigation District (YID). Reasonable use of groundwater for irrigation is helpful to maintain the agricultural production. Groundwater exploitation may cause groundwater level declines in local areas. This helps to reduce the salinity accumulation in the root zone but decreases the capillary rise. Thus, it is important to figure out the responses of soil water-salt dynamics and crop yields to groundwater table fluctuations for salinity control and stable yields. In this study, HYDRUS-1D model was modified by coupling with the EPIC (erosion-productivity impact calculator) crop growth module for simulating agro-hydrological processes. The new crop module could simulate crop height, leaf area index (LAI), above-ground biomass and crop yield. The information between HYDRUS-1D and EPIC was exchanged by daily step. Root water uptake under water and salt stress was calculated with HYDRUS-1D and imported to EPIC to limit crop growth. EPIC module estimated crop height, LAI and root depth for HYDRUS-1D to calculate soil water-solute dynamics. HYDRUS-1D assumed that soil evaporation remained at the potential rate unless pressure head of the soil surface decreased to a prescribed value. After then this prescribed value was set as a constant head to renew the top boundary condition. However, it cannot reasonably reflect the decrease stage of soil evaporation when using the constant head boundary. This may overestimate soil evaporation. Therefore, a new soil evaporation module, estimating soil evaporation reduction coefficient using soil water content of the top layer (0-10 cm), was added for better describing the soil evaporation under shallow water tables. With the experimental data collected from the maize field in 2008, the model was calibrated by the data of groundwater irrigation treatment and validated by the data of canal irrigation treatment. Simulated soil water content and solute concentration in the root zone (0-90 cm) showed good agreement with the measured values. Root mean square error (RMSE), mean relative error (MRE) and coefficient of determination for soil moisture were 0.03 cm", "pid": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e15049539"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Yuanyuan Hao", "org": "Chinese-Israeli International Center for Research and Training in Agriculture", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e15043baa"}, {"name": "Xu Xu", "org": "Chinese-Israeli International Center for Research and Training in Agriculture", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151f40c7"}, {"name": "Dongyang Ren", "org": "Chinese-Israeli International Center for Research and Training in Agriculture", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e15194d41"}, {"name": "Quanzhong Huang", "org": "Chinese-Israeli International Center for Research and Training in Agriculture", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ffdaad"}, {"name": "Guanhua Huang", "org": "Chinese-Israeli International Center for Research and Training in Agriculture", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15038143"}], "title": "Distributed modeling of soil water-salt dynamics and crop yields based on HYDRUS-EPIC model in Hetao Irrigation District", "keywords": ["Crops", "HYDRUS-EPIC", "Irrigation district scale", "Modeling", "Shallow groundwater level", "Soils"], "venue": "Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering", "year": 2015, "abstract": "Soil moisture and salinity are two key factors for crop production in arid irrigation districts. It is critical to modify soil water-salt dynamics and crop growth on a regional scale for the sustainable agriculture. In this paper, a distributed agro-hydrological model that well considers the spatial variability of soil and hydrological factors was developed to simulate soil water movement, solute transport and crop growth process on the regional scale. Jiefangzha Irrigation System (JIS) of the Hetao Irrigation District was selected as the study area. The JIS was divided into 201 homogeneous simulation units based on the combinations of weather-soil-crop-irrigation. In this way, the one-dimensional agro-hydrological model-HYDRUS-EPIC (HYDRUS-1D coupled with EPIC crop growth module), was used and expanded to the regional scale. Field experiments were conducted in 2012 and 2013. The dataset of soil moisture, soil solute concentration, leaf area index (LAI) and crop yield were collected at 40 monitoring points, and used for model calibration and validation. Simulated soil moisture and salinity concentration in the root zone showed good agreement with the measured values. During the calibration process, root mean square error (RMSE), mean relative error (MRE) and coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) for soil moisture were 0.03 cm<sup>3</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>, 0.3% and 0.67, respectively. For salinity concentration, RMSE, MRE and R<sup>2</sup> were 2.72 g/L, -13.5% and 0.53.LAI and crop yields were fitted well with the observations. MRE values for the estimated and measured LAI and crop yields were 1.0% and 1.1%, and R<sup>2</sup> were both larger than 0.90 for these two items. During the validation process, RMSE, MRE, and R<sup>2</sup> were 0.04 cm<sup>3</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>, 2.6%, 0.57 for soil moisture, and 2.62 g/L, -4.5%, 0.51 for salinity concentration, respectively. And MRE and R<sup>2</sup> were 9.1%, 0.88 for LAI, and -1.9%, 0.92 for crop yields. These results showed that the distributed agro-hydrological model was able to simulate the soil water flow, salt transport, and crop growth process in JIS with accuracy. The calibrated and validated model was then applied to predict spatial distribution of soil moisture, salinity concentration, crop evaporation and crop yields of the study area in present irrigation water management practices. Effective saturation and salinity concentration in the root zone were chosen to represent soil water and salinity stress on crop growth. Results showed that effective saturation ranged from 0.44 to 0.90 with an average of 0.7 for the JIS. In most areas, soil water could meet crop water consumption needs. In the areas where groundwater depth (GWD) was less than 1.3 m, root water uptake was limited due to waterlogging. The average salinity concentration in the root zone varied from 3.1 g/L in the northwest to 13.5 g/L in the northeast with an average of 6.4 g/L for the whole district. High soil salinity concentration limited crop production seriously. Corresponding to the spatial distribution of salinity concentration in the root zone, crop relative yield (ratio of actual yield and average yield of JIS) ranged from 0.33 to 1.33.The results suggested that for the northeastern part, where GWDs were larger than 2.0 m, more irrigation was needed for leaching salt. It was also better to plant more salt tolerant crops in these areas. In northwestern and southwestern parts, shallow groundwater levels intensified water logging or salinity accumulation problems. The study indicated that it is better to keep the groundwater depth not shallower than 1.3 m for maintaining the crop yields.", "pid": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1509271b"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Jueyao Wang", "org": "Harbin Institute of Technology", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e150965b5"}, {"name": "Xiaorui Zhu", "org": "Harbin Institute of Technology", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1511f287"}, {"name": "Fude Tie", "org": "National Museum of China", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e15155090"}, {"name": "Tao Zhao", "org": "Harbin Institute of Technology", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1518d9f5"}, {"name": "Xu Xu", "org": "National Museum of China", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150e04d4"}], "title": "Design of a modular robotic system for archaeological exploration", "keywords": ["Archaeological exploration", "Field tests", "Modular system", "Robot"], "venue": "Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation", "year": 2009, "abstract": "This paper presents the design and field tests of an intelligent robotic system for archaeological exploration.

In this follow-up study, env protein expression was evaluated immunohistochemically in an additional 195 paraffin-embedded breast tumors from a second U.S. patient cohort (Baltimore, Maryland) and in 110 tumors from Chinese patients. Moreover, we compared env transcript expression between fresh-frozen normal and cancerous breast tissues. We observed that while env mRNA and protein expression was undetectable in normal breast tissue and in a subset of uninvolved normal-appearing tissue adjacent to the tumor epithelium, it was overexpressed in most tumors. Furthermore, env expression was associated with breast cancer progression.

Color schlieren and surface oil-flow visualization pictures were taken in the vicinity of the injectors to obtain a qualitative assessment of the injector fio wf i elds. In hot flow experiments, the aerodynamic ramp injector with 2\u00d72 holes was investigated as baseline injector. 7 different combined aerodynamic ramp injector experiments were conducted for high equivalence (nearly 1. 0). Results of the experiments showed that the fuel from aero-ramp was mixed up fastly and had a strong interaction with the plume of gas portfire. In the condition of which the simulating flight Mach number is 5, a successful combustion was demonstrated by observing wall-static pressure rise in the combustor. Both subsonic and supersonic combustion modes were observed with ethylene fuel. One-dimensional performance analysis of the test data indicates that combustion efficiencies were 0. 56 \u223c0. 94.

In such cases, DPL requires that a layout feature be split into two parts. We address this problem using two layout decomposition approaches based on a conflict graph. First, node splitting is performed at all feasible dividing points. Then, one approach detects conflict cycles in the graph which are unresolvable for DPL coloring, and determines the coloring solution for the remaining nodes using integer linear programming (ILP). The other approach, based on a different ILP problem formulation, deletes some edges in the graph to make it two-colorable, then finds the coloring solution in the new graph.

This demonstrates that ultralong hierarchical vanadium oxide nanowire is one of the most favorable nanostructures as cathodes for improving cycling performance of lithium ion batteries. \u00a9 2010 American Chemical Society.", "pid": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150f2b61"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Li-Qiang Mai", "org": "Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e15199097"}, {"name": "Fan Yang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology for Materials Synthesis and Processing", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1508acfd"}, {"name": "Yun-Long Zhao", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology for Materials Synthesis and Processing", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150fb917"}, {"name": "Xu Xu", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology for Materials Synthesis and Processing", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e15187c25"}, {"name": "Lin Xu", "org": "Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e15201c35"}, {"name": "Yan-Zhu Luo", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology for Materials Synthesis and Processing", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fd4477"}], "title": "Hierarchical MnMoO4/CoMoO4 heterostructured nanowires with enhanced supercapacitor performance", "venue": "Nature Communications", "year": 2011, "abstract": "Recent attention has been focused on the synthesis and application of complex heterostructured nanomaterials, which can have superior electrochemical performance than single-structured materials.

Here, we demonstrate that ultralong LiV 3 O 8 nanowire cathode materials synthesized by topotactic Li intercalation are capable of excellent high-rate performance with minimal capacity loss. A specific discharge capacity of 176 mAh g 1 can be obtained at the current density of 1500 mA g 1, and the capacity is able to stabilize at 160 mAh g 1 after 400 cycles, corresponding to 0.025% capacity fading per cycle. For current density up to 2000, mA g 1, the initial and the six-hundredth cycle capacities can reach 137 and 120 mAh g 1, respectively, corresponding to a capacity fading of only 0.022% per cycle. The ability to provide this level of performance is attributed to a low-charge-transfer resistance, good structural stability, large surface area and suitable degree of crystallinity, and it indicates that LiV 3 O 8 nanowires are promising cathode materials for use in high-rate and long-life rechargeable Li batteries. \u00a9 2012 Nature Japan K.K.

Although the use of conductive carbon materials is promising, other methods are needed to reach high cyclability, which cannot be achieved by fully utilizing the surface-oxygen redox reactions of carbon. Here we introduce an effective strategy that utilizes Cu 2+ reduction with carbon-oxygen surface groups of the binder-free electrode in a new redox-active electrolyte. We report a 10-fold increase in the voltammetric capacitance (4,700 F g-1) compared with conventional electrolyte. We measured galvanostatic capacitances of 1,335 F g-1 with a retention of 99.4% after 5,000 cycles at 60 A g-1 in a three-electrode cell and 1,010 F g-1 in a two-electrode cell. This improvement is attributed to the synergistic effects between surface-oxygen molecules and electrolyte ions as well as the low charge transfer resistance (0.04 \u03a9) of the binder-free porous electrode. Our strategy provides a versatile method for designing new energy storage devices and is promising for the development of high-performance supercapacitors for large-scale applications. \u00a9 2013

Ion Transport with Single Nanowire Electrochemical Devices", "venue": "Nano Letters", "year": 2015, "abstract": "In the past decades, Li ion batteries are widely considered to be the most promising rechargeable batteries for the rapid development of mobile devices and electric vehicles. There arouses great interest in Na ion batteries, especially in the field of static grid storage due to their much lower production cost compared with Li ion batteries. However, the fundamental mechanism of Li and Na ion transport in nanoscale electrodes of batteries has been rarely experimentally explored. This insight can guide the development and optimization of high-performance electrode materials. In this work, single nanowire devices with multicontacts are designed to obtain detailed information during the electrochemical reactions. This unique platform is employed to in situ investigate and compare the transport properties of Li and Na ions at a single nanowire level. To give different confinement for ions and electrons during the electrochemical processes, two different configurations of nanowire electrode are proposed; one is to fully immerse the nanowire in the electrolyte, and the other is by using photoresist to cover the nanowire with only one end exposed. For both configurations, the conductivity of nanowire decreases after intercalation/deintercalation for both Li and Na ions, indicating that they share the similar electrochemical reaction mechanisms in layered electrodes. However, the conductivity degradation and structure destruction for Na ions is more severe than those of Li ions during the electrochemical processes, which mainly results from the much larger volume of Na ions and greater energy barrier encountered by the limited layered spaces. Moreover, the battery performances of coin cells are compared to further confirm this conclusion.

In this paper, we consider the network lifetime maximization problem for time-sensitive data gathering, which requires sensing data to be sent to the sink as soon as possible, subject to several constraints on the mobile sink. Because the mobile sink is powered by petrol or electricity, its maximum travel distance per tour is bounded. The mobile sink's maximum moving distance from its current location to the next must also be bounded to minimize data loss. As building a new routing tree rooted at each new location will incur an overhead on energy consumption, the mobile sink must sojourn at each chosen location at least for a certain amount of time. The problem, thus, is to find an optimal sojourn tour for the mobile sink such that the network lifetime is maximized, which is subject to a set of constraints on the mobile sink: its maximum travel distance, the maximum distance of each movement, and the minimum sojourn time at each sojourn location.

We first identified the indexes of the spatial organization of the petrochemical industry and established a comprehensive evaluation index system that includes four major categories and 11 indicators. The weight of each index was then determined by the analytical hierarchy process. Afterward, taking the 337 Chinese prefecture-level administrations as basic units and scientifically evaluating the potential comprehensive layout coefficients of the cities, 151 prefecture-level administrative units were selected as the basis for the choice of optimization sites with a linear programming model. Secondly, using the 151 prefecture-level administrative units and the maximum-coverage model, the optimal number and spatial distribution of refineries were identified for service radii of 100, 200 and 300 km. Thirdly, considering the actual distribution of China's refineries, general rules for the number of refinery layout points and objective values were summarized, and 52 refinery layout points were selected for China. Finally, with ArcGIS spatial analysis tools, the spatial effect of the 52 optimal refinery layout points was simulated for the service scope and socioeconomic factors respectively, and the GDP and population data for each refinery layout point were then extracted within the service scope. On this basis and with estimation of the intensity of crude-oil consumption, final results were obtained for the optimal spatial organization of the Chinese refining capacity and ethylene production capacity. \u00a9 2013 Science Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.", "pid": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e150767ce"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Kefeng Wang", "org": "School of Mathematical Science", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fe165e"}, {"name": "Xu Xu", "org": "School of Mathematical Science", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151ddc86"}, {"name": "Chonghui Guo", "org": "Institute of Systems Engineering", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e151663a3"}], "title": "A stable ICA algorithm based on exponent density and Gaussian parametric density mixture models", "keywords": ["family of density functions", "independent component analysis", "kurtsis", "maximum likelihood estimation", "natural gradient", "score function", "skewness"], "venue": "Proceedings of 2011 3rd International Conference on Awareness Science and Technology, iCAST 2011", "year": 2011, "abstract": "Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is an effective method to solve the problem of Blind Source Separation (BSS).

Subsystems of a complex system are mapped to the players of the game. The influence of collapsed subsystems to other subsystems is also taken into account in the definition of payoff function except for their own entropy increase. This influence is named brittleness entropy. Each player has two optional strategies: rational for negative entropy and irrational for negative entropy. The model is designed to identify the players who select an irrational strategy for negative entropy. The players who select the irrational strategy for negative entropy continue to compete for negative entropy after the recovery of ordered state and make other subsystems can't get enough negative entropy to reduce entropy increase. It leads to cascading failure of the complex system in the end. Genetic algorithm is used to seek the solution of game model, and the simulation result verifies the effectiveness of the proposed model.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the in vitro biocompatibility of bicomponent room temperature vulcanized polydimethylsiloxane intraocular lens materials after oxygen plasma processing. METHODS: Oxygen plasma treatment was employed to optimize the surface of intraocular lens materials using the surface modification technique. The power and duration were 20 W, 50 W, 100 W, and 30 seconds, 1 minute, 10 minutes, respectively. Water contact angle, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy-attenuated total reflection, X-ray photo electron spectroscopy analysis were adopted to analyze the hydrophilicity and the surface chemical composition of the material. Scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscope were used to observe the surface morphology. Cellular adhesion was performed by seeding human lens epithelial cells onto the surface of the materials to evaluate the effect of surface modification on its biocompatibility.

Obtaining the accurate permeability is helpful for effectively exploiting tight petroleum reservoirs. Due to the shortcomings of conventional steady-state permeability measurement method such as long experimental process and easily affected by the environmental temperature, this paper has conducted comparative study of permeability of 39 block rocks of tight reservoir using both steady-state and unsteady-state techniques. Meanwhile, those factors which affecting experimental results accuracy have also analyzed including permeability, experimental operation method and the way of combination of effective stress. The experimental results show that the unsteady-state pulse transient decay technique consistently underestimates the steady-state Klinkenberg-corrected permeability. Pulse decay permeability is only about 47.26% of the steady-state permeability in average. The difference between the above two different kinds of permeability increase with the decrease of the rock samples permeability. Error analysis suggests that the high effective about 9 MPa loaded on the rock sample before the pulse decay permeability measurement and the combination of high confining stress and high pore pressure can induce a portion of experimental error, but still not fully explain the overall error between the pulse decay permeability and the steady-state Klinkenberg-corrected permeability. Finally, mathematical fitting result shows that the relative error and the pulse decay permeability has a good logarithm function.", "pid": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15122a2a"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Xu Xu", "org": "Department of Applied Biology", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e150686aa"}, {"name": "Meng Wang", "org": "Department of Applied Biology", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f5501e"}, {"name": "Ying Wang", "org": "Department of Applied Biology", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e15046ec9"}, {"name": "Yanghu Sima", "org": "Department of Applied Biology", "id": "5b5433e3e1cd8e4e15f44b89"}, {"name": "Dayan Zhang", "org": "Department of Applied Biology", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e151936f5"}, {"name": "Juan Li", "org": "College of Forestry", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fa0c7d"}, {"name": "Weiming Yin", "org": "Laboratory Animal Centre", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1505b879"}, {"name": "Shiqing Xu", "org": "Department of Applied Biology", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e15184d2f"}], "title": "Green cocoons in silkworm Bombyx mori resulting from the quercetin 5-O-glucosyltransferase of UGT86, is an evolved response to dietary toxins", "keywords": ["Biological detoxification", "Bombyx mori", "Co-evolution", "Cocoon coloration", "UDP-glucosyltransferase"], "venue": "Molecular Biology Reports", "year": 2013, "abstract": "The glycosylation of UDP-glucosyltransferases (UGTs) is of great importance in the control and elimination of both endogenous and exogenous toxins. Bm-UGT10286 (UGT86) is the sole provider of UGT activity against the 5-O position of quercetin and directly influences the formation of green pigment in the Bombyx cocoon. To evaluate whether cocoon coloration evolved for mimetic purposes, we concentrated on the expression pattern of Ugt86 and the activities of the enzyme substrates. The expression of Ugt86 was not only detected in the cocoon absorbing and accumulating tissues such as the digestive tube and silk glands, but also in quantity in the detoxification tissues of the malpighian tubes and fat body, as well as in the gonads. As in the green cocoon strains, Ugt86 was clearly expressed in the yellow and white cocoon strains. In vitro, the fusion protein of UGT86 showed quercetin metabolic activity. Nevertheless, Ugt86 expression of 5th instar larvae was not up-regulated in the silk gland by exogenous quercetin. However, it was significantly up-regulated in the digestive tube and gonads (P < 0.05). A similar result was observed in experiments where larvae were exposed to rutin, an insect resistance inducer and growth inhibitor typically found in plants, and to 20-hydroxylecdysone (20E), an insect endocrine and plant source hormone. On the contrary, up-regulated Ugt86 expression was almost nil in larvae exposed to juvenile hormone III (P > 0.05). The results of HPLC revealed that a new substance was formed by mixing 20E with the recombinant UGT86 protein in vitro, indicating that the effect of Ugt86 on 20E was similar to that on exogenous quercetin derived from plant food, and that the effect probably initiated the detoxification reaction against rutin. The conclusion is that the reaction of Ugt86 on the silkworm cocoon pigment quercetin is not the result of active mimetic ecogenesis, but derives from the detoxification of UGTs. \u00a9 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.", "pid": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e15077ccf"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Hong-Xia Yuan", "org": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Environment Functional Materials", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1503f740"}, {"name": "Xu Xu", "org": "Department of Applied Biology", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e150686aa"}, {"name": "Yang-Hu Sima", "org": "Department of Applied Biology", "id": "5b5433e3e1cd8e4e15f44b89"}, {"name": "Shi-Qing Xu", "org": "Department of Applied Biology", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e15184d2f"}], "title": "Reproductive toxicity effects of 4-nonylphenol with known endocrine disrupting effects and induction of vitellogenin gene expression in silkworm, Bombyx mori", "keywords": ["4-Nonylphenol", "Bombyx mori", "Reproductive development", "Toxicity", "Vitellogenin gene"], "venue": "Chemosphere", "year": 2013, "abstract": "4-Nonylphenol (4-NP) a known endocrine disrupting chemical is a persistent environmental contaminant.

The knowledge on the thermal conductivity of AAC is required for thermal design of building envelopes. The effective thermal conductivity of AAC is strongly dependent on the moisture content. Such dependence, however, is not well documented in available literature. In this work, AAC bricks with three different bulk densities of 415, 520, and 630 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, were obtained as the raw materials, and the samples were prepared by humidification to a set of moisture content levels up to 100% by mass. The effective thermal conductivity of the moisturized samples was measured by means of the transient plane source technique. Meanwhile, fractal models for predicting the effective thermal conductivity were proposed based on construction of the porous structure of AAC by self-similar Sierpinski carpet. A two-phase fractal model was first proposed for dry AAC samples, and then an extension to a three-phase model was developed by considering the presence of water phase in the pores for unsaturated, moist samples. It was shown that the thermal conductivity increases with increasing the moisture content, by a factor up to 3.8 over the studied range of moisture content, following a two-section piecewise linear variation. A high-to-low slope change was found to be around a moisture content of 15% for all the AAC samples. A correlation was proposed for the measured thermal conductivity as a function of both moisture content and porosity. Appropriate parameters for the two-phase model were determined by comparing the predicted results to the measured data at dry state. The three-phase fractal model was exhibited to be able to predict the hygric dependence of thermal conductivity. The discrepancy among the predictions by the three-phase model with different geometric parameters was discussed in relation to the constructed pore structures. The predicted results by the two configurations of the three-phase model, i.e., with and without considering the presence of connected water bridges in the pores, were also presented. A reasonable elimination of the presence of connected bridges was shown to lead to better predictions in the low moisture content regime.", "pid": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f9af50"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Pinjing Hui", "org": "Department of Neurosurgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fa40f6"}, {"name": "Xu Xu", "org": "Department of Biochemical and Molecular Biology Medical College, Soochow University", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150d7e26"}, {"name": "Lan Xu", "org": "Department of Biochemical and Molecular Biology Medical College, Soochow University", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ff6fb8"}, {"name": "Guozhen Hui", "org": "Department of Neurosurgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e15044dde"}, {"name": "Shiliang Wu", "org": "Department of Biochemical and Molecular Biology Medical College, Soochow University", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15019860"}, {"name": "Qing Lan", "org": "Department of Neurosurgery, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f4f39a"}], "title": "Expression of MMP14 in invasive pituitary adenomas: Relationship to invasion and angiogenesis", "keywords": ["ATT20", "Invasive pituitary adenomas", "MMP14", "PTTG", "VEGF"], "venue": "International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Pathology", "year": 2015, "abstract": "Pituitary adenomas (PAs) are noncancerous tumors, and about 35% of those reported to be invasive have been classified as \"invasive pituitary adenomas (IPAs)\".

Invasive mechanism is a complex process, including metalloproteases, inhibitors and tumor microenvironment factors etc. Thus, studying invasive mechanism of PAs might contribute to understanding its biological behavior. In our research, three type tissue samples of human, pituitaries, PAs, IPAs, their mRNA expression of MMP1, MMP2, MMP9, MMP14, and MMP15 were measured using real-time PCR. MMP2 and MMP14 protein levels also were measured with immunohistochemistry in same samples. We confirmed that elevated matrix metalloproteinase-14 expression correlates with invasive characteristics of IPAs. To investigate molecular mechanism of how MMP14 contributes to invasiveness, an ATT20 cell was used in this study. After transient-transfection of the MMP14-shRNA expression vector into ATT20 cells, we observed that mRNA expression of PTTG, VEGF, and TGF\u03b2 was significantly suppressed in interference groups. Meanwhile, ATT20 cells in high concentration TIMP-1 environment exhibit reduced PTTG, VEGF, and TGF\u03b2 expression accompanied with the down-regulation of MMP14.

By adjusting \u03b1, the upper and lower bound solutions in the strain energy norm and eigenfrequencies can always be obtained. The optimized \u03b1 value in 3D H-SFEM using a tetrahedron mesh possesses a close-to-exact stiffness of the continuous system, and produces ultra-accurate solutions in terms of displacement, strain energy and eigenfrequencies in the linear and nonlinear problems. The novel domain-based selective scheme is proposed leading to a combined selective H-SFEM model that is immune from volumetric locking and hence works well for nearly incompressible materials. The proposed 3D H-SFEM is an innovative and unique numerical method with its distinct features, which has great potential in the successful application for solid mechanics problems.", "pid": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15120489"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Huili Liu", "org": "Civil Engineering Department of Shanghai University", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15029d4a"}, {"name": "Xu Xu", "org": "Civil Engineering Department of Shanghai University", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151ccdd0"}], "title": "Reliability analysis of asphalt pavement considering two failure modes", "venue": "Civil Engineering and Urban Planning III - Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Civil Engineering and Urban Planning, CEUP 2014", "year": 2014, "abstract": "Asphalt pavement has multiple failure modes, which are usually considered as independent modes. In this paper, reliability analysis of asphalt pavement considering both the fatigue cracking and rutting failure modes based on the Response Surface method and the Monte Carlo method was carried out. Then, sensitivity analysis was conducted to find that the most important parameter affecting the reliability for both failure modes was the surface layer thickness. The calculation results showed that the probability of simultaneous occurrence of these two failure modes can be as high as the probability of either mode individually. Therefore, to improve the asphalt pavement performance, simultaneous failure modes should be taken into account instead of the individual failure mode. In addition, the simultaneous failure probability was found to increase considerably with small increments in the traffic loads. \u00a9 2014 Taylor & Francis Group.", "pid": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e15157a66"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Yang Jiao", "org": "Department of Physics, Northwest University", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150f1702"}, {"name": "Xu Xu", "org": "Department of Physics, Northwest University", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1511d2c4"}, {"name": "Chen-Lu Zhou", "org": "Department of Physics, Northwest University", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f5ac70"}, {"name": "Chen-Di Zhan", "org": "Department of Physics, Northwest University", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151d7fbb"}, {"name": "Meng-Yao Guo", "org": "Department of Physics, Northwest University", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15facf2c"}, {"name": "Hai-Bo Fan", "org": "Department of Physics, Northwest University", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e15157b51"}, {"name": "Yuan-Qing Chen", "org": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Xi'an University of Technology", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1509527d"}], "title": "Preparation of diverse nanostructured ZnO films and their hydrophobic properties", "venue": "Faguang Xuebao/Chinese Journal of Luminescence", "year": 2014, "abstract": "ZnO films with diverse nanostructures, including nanorod array, nanotube array, and nanosheet array were prepared.

A new positioning method with multi-optical theodolites is proposed based on Hermite function restriction. This method can be called function restricted EMBET method. This method uses Hermite function to express the positioning parameters to compress the number of parameters to be estimated, and meanwhile the measuring elements of optical theodolite can be expressed. The measuring equation can be formed by measuring data of multiple measuring elements. Based on least square criterion, the positioning parameters are obtained by computing the combined equation, and the system errors of measuring elements are calibrated.

Material and methods: The prostate cancer cell line LNCaP and late cell line DU145 were treated with different concentrations of 4-HNE. The cell proliferation, apoptosis and mitochondrial transmembrane potential were detected at different time points, and expression of related molecules in cell proliferation and apoptosis signal pathway was analyzed by Western blot, and the over-expression of glutathione S-transferase (GSTA-4) wasv used to validate the changes of the effects of 4-HNE on the two kinds of cells. Results: LNCaP cells showed greater antiproliferative and proapoptotic activities of HNE in a time- and dose-dependent manner corresponding to the activation of p53-mediated intrinsic apoptotic signaling, but JNK activation was not observed. In contrast, HNE-treated DU145 cells showed less apoptosis and proliferation was not inhibited; instead there was sustained activation of JNK, but activation of p53, p-p53, p21, Bax and caspase-3 was not observed. In addition, their effect of induction of apoptosis can be inhibited by overexpression of GSTA-4. Conclusions: These studies suggest that 4-HNE promotes prostate cancer cell apoptosis through the p53 signaling pathway; the differences of sensitivity to 4-HNE in LNCaP and DU145 cells may be related to the androgen sensitivity of prostate cancer cells; and the 4-HNE-induced p53-mediated apoptosis signal is regulated by GSTA-4.", "pid": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15016275"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Mingkai Bao", "org": "College of Chemical Engineering, Nanjing Forestry University", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150ef88c"}, {"name": "Sisi Xiong", "org": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e15133bc6"}, {"name": "Mingzhen Cao", "org": "College of Chemical Engineering, Nanjing Forestry University", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1505c48a"}, {"name": "Xu Xu", "org": "College of Chemical Engineering, Nanjing Forestry University", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150df780"}, {"name": "Shifa Wang", "org": "College of Chemical Engineering, Nanjing Forestry University", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f7df86"}, {"name": "Zhijie Zhang", "org": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1502ce23"}], "title": "Synthesis and biological activities of novel 4-aryl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinazolin-2-amine derivatives", "keywords": ["Antitumor activity", "Synthesis", "Tetrahydroquinazolin-2-amine", "\u03b1-pinene"], "venue": "Chinese Journal of Organic Chemistry", "year": 2014, "abstract": "The intermediate compounds 4-arylidene isopinanones 3a~3h were synthesized by using \u03b1-pinene as starting material in three steps reaction including addition, oxidation, and condensation with aromatic aldehydes.

However, their pathological mechanism remains largely unknown. The aim of our study is to identify gallstones and GPs related-genes and gain an insight into the underlying genetic basis of these diseases. Methods: We enrolled 7 patients with gallstones and 2 patients with GP for RNA-Seq and we conducted functional enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks analysis for identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Results: RNA-Seq produced 41.7 million in gallstones and 32.1 million pairs in GPs. A total of 147 DEGs was identified between gallstones and GPs. We found GO terms for molecular functions significantly enriched in antigen binding (GO:0003823, P=5.9E-11), while for biological processes, the enriched GO terms were immune response (GO:0006955, P=2.6E-15), and for cellular component, the enriched GO terms were extracellular region (GO:0005576, P=2.7E-15). To further evaluate the biological significance for the DEGs, we also performed the KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. The most signifi cant pathway in our KEGG analysis was Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction (P=7.5E-06). PPI network analysis indicated that the significant hub proteins containing S100A9 (S100 calcium binding protein A9, Degree=94) and CR2 (complement component receptor 2, Degree=8).

But the signals from different speakers have similar components when divided into speech segments. We take the unique and similar components of different speakers' signals into account, and design a new structured dictionary which contains discriminative and buffer sub-dictionaries. The unique components of different speakers' signals which have better correspondences to the speakers' labels are firstly separated, and the similar components of different speakers' signals are separated in the next layer. An objective function is derived, which guarantees that the unique components of the training sets can be explained by their corresponding discriminative sub-dictionaries and the similar components of the training sets can be explained by the buffer sub-dictionary rather than the cross sub-dictionary.

Present work was motivated by the experimental investigations conducted in Beihang University\u2019s Supersonic Combustion Facility. High enthalpy clean air was heated to a total temperature of 970K, entering the isolator entrance at a Mach number of 2.03. The fuel was injected through six transverse injectors upstream of the first cavity, and the flame was not able to self-sustain under this low inflow total temperature. Consequently, a transverse gas jet produced by a dependent gas generator was injected into the combustor from the bottom of the first cavity to aid the ignition and flame stabilization. Three-dimensional compressible, turbulent, non-reacting and reacting flow calculations with a single-step chemistry model were performed on the two arrangements with or without gas jet. The turbulence model adopted the shear stress transport (SST) k-\u03c9 turbulence model. The particles stochastic trajectory model was used to track the interactions between the liquid n-decane and main stream. The predicted static pressure profiles along the combustor upper and side walls were compared with the experimental data to validate the numerical model and provide insight into the experimental flowfield behavior. The axial variations of combustion efficiency and total pressure loss were obtained to assess the combustion performance of the model combustor. The non-reacting numerical results show that the transverse gas jet induced an intense bow shock wave which decelerated the inflow, resulting in an obvious recirculation region downstream of the first cavity. The reacting numerical results show that the stable combustion cannot be achieved without the ignition aid. The flame was limited in the vicinity of the upper wall and two cavities, and the combustion efficiency at combustor exit was 20%. With the aid of high temperature gas jet, the plume depth of flame was greatly enhanced, and the main stream was successfully ignited.

They then assessed their levels of self-insight. Results showed that women engaged in greater processing than did men. Gender differences also manifested in the relationship between level of self-insight and word processing. For women, level of self-insight was associated with level of semantic activation for emotion words and abstract neutral words, but not for concrete neutral words. For men, level of self-insight was related to processing speed, particularly in response to abstract and concrete neutral words.

In some recent studies, the possibility of using the portable, low cost, and marker-less Microsoft Kinect\u2122 sensor to measure gait parameters on over-ground walking has been examined. The current study further examined the accuracy level of the Kinect sensor for assessment of various gait parameters during treadmill walking under different walking speeds. Twenty healthy participants walked on the treadmill and their full body kinematics data were measured by a Kinect sensor and a motion tracking system, concurrently. Spatiotemporal gait parameters and knee and hip joint angles were extracted from the two devices and were compared. The results showed that the accuracy levels when using the Kinect sensor varied across the gait parameters. Average heel strike frame errors were 0.18 and 0.30 frames for the right and left foot, respectively, while average toe off frame errors were -2.25 and -2.61 frames, respectively, across all participants and all walking speeds. The temporal gait parameters based purely on heel strike have less error than the temporal gait parameters based on toe off. The Kinect sensor can follow the trend of the joint trajectories for the knee and hip joints, though there was substantial error in magnitudes. The walking speed was also found to significantly affect the identified timing of toe off.

Gait and motion analyses of the lower extremities of 20 young and 20 older adults during floor to stair (F-S) and stair to floor (S-F) walking transitions provided continuous measures of relative phase (CRP) that assessed inter-joint coordination of the hip, knee, and angle joints. The mean absolute relative phase (MARP) and deviation phase (DP) provided descriptive metrics for CRP pattern and variability respectively. For hip-knee CRP pattern, older adults demonstrated significantly smaller MARP than young adults in stance and most swing phases during F-S and S-F. For knee-ankle, older adults showed a significant smaller MARP of the trailing limb during S-F than young adults. In most stance and swing phases, the hip-knee DP values of older adults were significantly lower than that of young adults.

However, the affected signaling mechanisms are not clearly clarified. In the present study, we confirm that miR-29c is expressed during mice brain development and increases neurite outgrowth via decreasing PTEN expression. We first screen the picked-out miR-29c up-regulated in PC12 cells induced by nerve growth factor (NGF). In silico analysis of possible miR-29c targets, VEGFA, MAPK3, PDGFB, and PTEN mRNA are proposed as relatively likely putative binding sites for miR-29c. Subsequently, we detect that miR-29c is involved in brain development and has a negative relationship with the expression of PTEN. Then, using luciferase reporter assay,we demonstrate that miR-29c could directly target to the 3\u2032-UTR of PTEN mRNA and result in down-expression of PTEN. By infecting PC12 cells with lentiviral pLKO-miR-29c or control, we also find that increasing levels of miR-29c markedly increase Akt phosphorylation level, and thus, promote neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells. Together, our results identify that miR-29c is required for mice brain development and modulates neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells via targeting PTEN and has a promising therapeutic target for neural disease.", "pid": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1518f499"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Li-Wu Fan", "org": "Key Laboratory of Efficient Utilization of Low, Medium Grade Energy (Tianjin University), Ministry of Education of China", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ffdef1"}, {"name": "Xiao-Li Yao", "org": "Institute of Thermal Science and Power Systems, School of Energy Engineering, Zhejiang University", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e1500716e"}, {"name": "Xiao Wang", "org": "Department of Thermal and Energy Metrology, Zhejiang Institute of Metrology", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151c19ba"}, {"name": "Yu-Yue Wu", "org": "Institute of Thermal Science and Power Systems, School of Energy Engineering, Zhejiang University", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e15092414"}, {"name": "Xue-Ling Liu", "org": "Key Laboratory of Efficient Utilization of Low, Medium Grade Energy (Tianjin University), Ministry of Education of China", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fcb71a"}, {"name": "Xu Xu", "org": "College of Metrological and Measurement Engineering, China Jiliang University", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15faf546"}, {"name": "Zi-Tao Yu", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Clean Energy Utilization, Zhejiang University", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fe176f"}], "title": "Non-isothermal crystallization of aqueous nanofluids with high aspect-ratio carbon nano-additives for cold thermal energy storage", "keywords": ["Aqueous nanofluids", "Carbon nanotubes", "Graphene", "Non-isothermal crystallization", "Phase change materials", "Thermal energy storage"], "venue": "Applied Energy", "year": 2015, "abstract": "Non-isothermal crystallization of aqueous nanofluids in the presence of two types of high aspect-ratio carbon nano-additives, i.e., carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs), was characterized by means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).

In addition to the supercooling degree and latent heat of crystallization, the crystallization kinetics was also analyzed by both the Ozawa method and a modified Ozawa-based method. It was shown that dilute loading of CNTs or GNPs leads to reduction of the supercooling degree up to 5. \u00b0C due to the nucleating effect. The planarly-shaped GNPs featuring large contact area perform better than CNTs in facilitating heterogeneous nucleation, which greatly suppress crystal growth during the late phase of non-isothermal crystallization. In contrast to the case of GNPs, CNTs may be able to accelerate crystallization up to nearly 37% at relatively dilute loadings, especially when the cooling rate is low.

However, such approach fails to include many important data points and has a low level of quantification, which causes the difficulty in identifying insights on the location, causes, and characteristics of environmental problems. Hybrid life cycle assessment (LCA), which combines input\u2013output data and process-based LCA, has recently been proposed and widely implemented for the collection of regional inventory. However, the limitation of using input\u2013output data, which involves the adoption of averaging data associated with different inputs within various industry subsectors, has been highlighted. In this study, national and provincial statistical data combined with the bottom\u2013up approach is used to solve the aforementioned problems and to assess the environmental effects of mechanical coke production at a national level. Methods: A bottom\u2013up approach combined with national and regional statistical data on product yield is used in this study to estimate the environmental effects and improvement potential of mechanical coke production at the national level. Results and discussion: The total mechanical coke production and environmental burden generated by global warming, respiratory inorganics, and nonrenewable energy in 2010 were approximately 3.31 \u00d7 10<sup>8</sup>\u00a0t, 1.01 \u00d7 10<sup>8</sup>\u00a0t-CO<inf>2</inf> eq., 1.98 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup>\u00a0t\u00a0PM<inf>2.5</inf> eq., and 1.05 \u00d7 10<sup>10</sup> GJ Primary, respectively. The highest coke production fluxes were found in Shanghai, followed by Tianjin, Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, and Henan. The lowest coke production was observed in Hainan and Xizang. The difference can be attributed to coal mining and economic levels. From 2008 to 2012, the CO<inf>2</inf>, SO<inf>2</inf>, and NOx emissions as well as nonrenewable energy consumption for mechanical coke production accounted for 0.5 to 1.4, 1.5 to 2.2, 3.8 to 4.7, and 4.8 to 13.2\u00a0% of the total CO<inf>2</inf>, SO<inf>2</inf>, and NOx emissions and nonrenewable energy consumption in China, respectively. The following processes are highly important in reducing the environmental burden imposed by mechanical coke production in China: optimizing the transport distance and type, using underground coal washing technology, decreasing coke exports, and improving the efficiency of coking coal consumption, the average usage rate of seam gas drainage, the energy recovery rate of coke dry quenching technology, and the amount of imported coking coal. Conclusions: The most significant processes, substances, and potential environmental impact categories that contribute to the overall environmental burden in China can be easily evaluated. The combination of national information, provincial statistical data, and LCA results on mechanical coke production represents a large group of LCA products that can further determine the key improvement factors for reducing the national overall environmental burden imposed by the manufacturing of mechanical coke.", "pid": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15016dc7"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Chengdong Zhang", "org": "College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Pollution Processes and Environmental Criteria, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Environmental Remediation and Pollution Control Nankai University", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fb75e8"}, {"name": "Mingzhu Li", "org": "College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Pollution Processes and Environmental Criteria, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Environmental Remediation and Pollution Control Nankai University", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fcf62c"}, {"name": "Xu Xu", "org": "Key Laboratory of Groundwater Resources and Environment, Ministry of Education, Jilin University", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e15107465"}, {"name": "Na Liu", "org": "Key Laboratory of Groundwater Resources and Environment, Ministry of Education, Jilin University", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fcd1a5"}], "title": "Effects of carbon nanotubes on atrazine biodegradation by Arthrobacter sp", "keywords": ["Adsorption", "Atrazine", "Biodegradation", "Carbon nanotubes"], "venue": "Journal of Hazardous Materials", "year": 2015, "abstract": "The environmental risks of engineered nanoparticles have attracted attention. However, little is known regarding the effects of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on the biodegradation and persistence of organic contaminants in water. We investigated the impacts of pristine and oxidized multiwalled CNTs on the atrazine biodegradation rate and efficiency using Arthrobacter sp. At a concentration of 25. mg/L, the CNTs enhanced the biodegradation rate by up to 20%; however, at a concentration of 100. mg/L, the CNTs decreased the biodegradation rate by up to 50%. The stimulation effects resulted from enhanced bacterial growth and the overexpression of degradation genes. The inhibitory effects resulted from the toxicity of the CNTs at high concentrations. The differences between the two CNTs at tested concentrations were not significant. The biodegradation efficiency was not impacted by adsorption, and the pre-adsorbed atrazine on the CNTs was fully biodegraded when the CNT concentration was \u226425. mg/L. This finding was consistent with the lack of observable desorption hysteresis for atrazine on the tested CNTs.
