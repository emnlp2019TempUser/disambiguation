In the present study, we aimed to confirm the cardioprotective effect of Danshensu from myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) injury in vivo, and investigate the potential molecular mechanisms against simulated ischemia/reperfusion (SI/R) induced cardiomyocytes apoptosis in vitro. The rat model of MI/R injury was induced by a transient vessel occlusion for 30 min and reperfusion for 3 h, Danshensu significantly reduced myocardium infarct size and the production of creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), cardiac troponin (cTnI) in serum. In vitro experiment, H9c2 cardiomyocytes were incubated with vehicle or ischemic buffer during hypoxia, and then it was reoxygenated with or without Danshensu. Danshensu markedly improved cell viability and decreased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. We confirmed anti-apoptotic effect of Danshensu both by flow-cytometric analysis and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay, and this effect was associated with the increase of Bcl-2/Bax ratio and the decrease of active caspase-3 expression. Western blot analysis also showed that Danshensu increased phosphorylation of Akt and extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) in H9c2 cells, and the protective effects of Danshensu were partially inhibited by phosphatidylinositol 3\u2032-kinase (PI3K) specific inhibitor wortmannin or ERK specific inhibitor U0126. Our results suggested that Danshensu could provide significant cardioprotection against MI/R injury, and the potential mechanisms might to suppression of cardiomyocytes apoptosis through activating the PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: Primary cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were exposed to anoxia for 3 h followed by reoxygenation for 6 h. The cell viability was measured using MTT assay. The releases of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK), level of malondialdehyde (MDA), and activities of glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were analyzed. Hoechst 33258 staining and changes in Bcl-2/Bax ratio and caspase 3 activity were used to examine A/R-induced apoptosis. Results: The A/R exposure markedly decreased the viability of cardiomyocytes, suppressed the activities of SOD, GSH, CAT and GSH-Px, and Bcl-2 protein expression. Meanwhile, the A/R exposure markedly increased the release of LDH and CK, and MDA production in the cardiomyocytes, and increased the rate of apoptosis, caspase 3 activity, Bax protein expression. Pretreatment with SYA (40, 60 and 80 nmol/L) concentration-dependently blocked the A/R-induced changes in the cardiomyocytes. Pretreatment of the cardiomyocytes with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 200 \u03bcmol/L) produced protective effects that were comparable to those caused by SYA (80 nmol/L).Conclusion:SYA protects cultured rat cardiomyocytes against A/R injury, maybe via inhibiting cellular oxidative stress and apoptosis. \u00a9 2013 CPS and SIMM All rights reserved.", "pid": "5b5433e3e1cd8e4e15f4551e"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Guo Wei", "org": "Department of Pharmacy", "id": "5b5433e3e1cd8e4e15f438d1"}, {"name": "Yue Guan", "org": "Department of Pharmacy", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1504b172"}, {"name": "Ying Yin", "org": "Department of Pharmacy", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1501f5c3"}, {"name": "Jialin Duan", "org": "Department of Pharmacy", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151c1b05"}, {"name": "Dan Zhou", "org": "Department of Pharmacy", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150cf934"}, {"name": "Yanrong Zhu", "org": "Department of Pharmacy", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e15092017"}, {"name": "Wei Quan", "org": "Department of Pharmacy", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e150594ad"}, {"name": "Miaomiao Xi", "org": "Department of Pharmacy", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15ff1f25"}, {"name": "Aidong Wen", "org": "Department of Pharmacy", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150c8ca2"}], "title": "Anti-inflammatory effect of protocatechuic aldehyde on myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury in vivo and in vitro", "keywords": ["anti-inflammatory", "cardiomyocytes", "myocardial ischemia/reperfusion", "nuclear factor-kappa B", "protocatechuic aldehyde"], "venue": "Inflammation", "year": 2013, "abstract": "Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) injury, in which inflammatory response plays a vital role, is frequently encountered in clinical practice.

The rat model of MI/R injury was induced by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery for 30 min, followed by 3-h reperfusion, and pretreatment with PAl could protect the heart from MI/R injury by reducing myocardial infarct size and the activities of creatine kinase-MB and cardiac troponin I (cTn-I) in serum. Also, PAl administration markedly reduced cellular injury induced by simulated ischemia/reperfusion (SI/R) in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, which was evidenced by increased cell viability, reduced lactate dehydrogenase and cTn-I activities in the culture medium, and greatly decreased percentage of cell apoptosis. Moreover, the levels of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-6, intracellular adhesion molecule-1, phosphorylated I\u03baB-\u03b1, and the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) were all evidently decreased by PAl both in vivo and in vitro. Taken together, these observations suggested that PAl could exert great protective effects against MI/R injury in rats and SI/R injury in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, and the cardioprotective mechanism might be involved in the suppression of inflammatory response via inhibiting the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. \u00a9 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.", "pid": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fd90db"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Wei Quan", "org": "Department of Pharmacy", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e150594ad"}, {"name": "Ying Yin", "org": "Department of Pharmacy", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1501f5c3"}, {"name": "Miaomiao Xi", "org": "Department of Pharmacy", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15ff1f25"}, {"name": "Dan Zhou", "org": "Department of Pharmacy", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150cf934"}, {"name": "Yanrong Zhu", "org": "Department of Pharmacy", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e15092017"}, {"name": "Yue Guan", "org": "Department of Pharmacy", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1504b172"}, {"name": "Chao Guo", "org": "Department of Pharmacy", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150c23a4"}, {"name": "Yanhua Wang", "org": "Department of Pharmacy", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e15086227"}, {"name": "Jialin Duan", "org": "Department of Pharmacy", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151c1b05"}, {"name": "Aidong Wen", "org": "Department of Pharmacy", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150c8ca2"}], "title": "Antioxidant properties of magnesium lithospermate B contribute to the cardioprotection against myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury in vivo and in vitro", "keywords": ["Antioxidants", "In vitro", "Ischemia", "Magnesium lithospermate B", "Myocytes,Cardiac", "Oxidative stress", "Reperfusion injury"], "venue": "Journal of Traditional Chinese Medicine", "year": 2013, "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the cardioprotective effect of magnesium lithospermate B (MLB) on myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) injury and to investigate the antioxidant potential in vivo and in vitro. METHODS: MI/R injury was induced by the occlusion of left anterior descending coronary artery for 30 min followed by reperfusion for 3 h in rats. After reperfusion, hearts were harvested to assess infarct size, histopathological damages, the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), reduced glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA). Blood samples were collected to determine serum levels of creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), cardiac troponin (cTnI) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Furthermore, simulated ischemia/reperfusion (SI/R) injury in vitro was established by oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) for 2 h followed by 24-hour recovery period in cardiomyocytes. The activity of LDH in the cultured supernatant and the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), SOD and MDA in cardiomyocytes were also measured. Finally, cardiomyocytes apoptosis was determined with flow cytometry. RESULTS: MLB significantly limited infarct size, ameliorated histopathological damages and prevented leakage of CK-MB, cTnI and LDH. Additionally, SOD, CAT, GPx and GSH activities were notably increased by MLB, along with the MDA content decreased as compared with the model group in rats. In vitro study, MLB also decreased LDH activity in the cultured supernatant, increased SOD activity in cardiomyocytes, reduced intracellular ROS and MDA levels, and significantly suppressed cardiomyocytes apoptosis. CONCLUSION: MLB possessed remarkably cardioprotective effects on MI/R injury in vivo and in vitro. The protection of MLB may contribute to its antioxidant properties. \u00a9 2013 JTCM.

Danhong injection (DHI), a very popular Chinese medicine injection, is reported to be effective for many cardiovascular conditions. The primary active ingredients of DHI, and their systemic and interrelated mechanism have not been evaluated in an established myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) model. We identified the main active constituents in DHI, including hydroxysafflor yellow A (A), salvianolic acid B (B), and danshensu (C), by HPLC fingerprint analysis and assessed their effect on MI/R rats and cardiomyocytes. These 3 compounds and DHI all decreased the levels of IL-1, TNF-\u03b1, and MDA, increased those of IL-10 and SOD activity in vivo and in vitro, and had antiapoptotic effects, as shown by flow cytometric analysis and TUNEL assay. Moreover, these compounds increased phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2 in cardiomyocytes. Interestingly, we found compound A exerted a more prominent anti-inflammatory effect than B and C, by decreasing NF-B levels; compound B had more powerful antioxidative capacity than A and C, by increasing Nrf2 expression; compound C had stronger antiapoptotic ability than A and B, by lowering caspase-3 activity.

These patients received oral atorvastatin 20 mg/day for 1-6 months (3.02 \u00b1 1.77 months) and were followed for 3 to 36 months (18.62 \u00b1 13.13) after the therapy. Hematoma volume, neurological functions and daily activities (measured using the Activities of Daily Life-the Barthel Index scale, ADL-BI) were compared before and after treatment with Linear Trend Chi-Square test. Results Twenty-two of the 23 patients experienced improvements in symptoms, and the reduction in hematoma volume from 48.70 \u00b1 20.38 ml to 16.64 \u00b1 14.28 ml (paired-sample t-test, p < 0.01) within the first month of the treatment. Hematoma was completely resolved in 17 patients (77.3%) and shrank by more than 73.99% \u00b1 11.17% in 5 patients (22.7%) 3 months after the treatment was initiated. One patient experienced an initial relief of symptoms, but his condition deteriorated with an enlarged hematoma during the 4th week of treatment and underwent surgery. At 6 months, 18 patients presented no hematoma by CT or MRI and four patients, whose hematoma was completely resolved at 3 months, were not followed. None of these 22 patients relapsed during the entire follow-up period of 3-36 months. All have improved MGS, GCS, and ADL-BI. No atorvastatin-related side effects were documented. Conclusion Results of this preliminary prospective study show that the oral administration of atorvastatin is safe and effective in treating CSDH, offering a cost-effective alternative to surgery. A prospective randomized clinical trial is required to validate the effect of atorvastatin. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.

A common dilemma that multiple target tracking methods have to face in practice is reducing computational cost and addressing occlusion to achieve efficient and robust long-duration tracking. Existing methods mainly focus on deriving the measurement-to-track assignment through probabilistic analysis, in which the motions of targets are considered to be independent of each other. These methods tend to be computationally expensive due to the complexity of implementation for the visual tracking task. In this paper, we propose a collaboration model in which the acceleration difference between two targets is used to calculate the motion correlation value based on the two-dimensional Gaussian function. By the collaboration model, the location of occluded target is estimated using the motion information from other targets. In order to sense the occurrence of an occlusion accurately before estimating the location of target, we also propose a border-based occlusion decision method which is integrated into our tracking framework. The proposed approach is computationally efficient and robust. Experimental results exhibit the performance of the tracker based on our approach. \u00a9 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.", "pid": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fbfc15"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Wei Quan", "org": "School of Transportation Science and Engineering", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e15160d46"}, {"name": "Xin Liu", "org": "School of Transportation Science and Engineering", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f8d6f4"}, {"name": "Datong Liu", "org": "School of Transportation Science and Engineering", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15002a0c"}], "title": "A wearable human gesture sensor with enviromental universality", "keywords": ["gesture measurement", "human pose and motion", "joint angle", "multifunction", "wearable sensor"], "venue": "2012 25th IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering: Vision for a Greener Future, CCECE 2012", "year": 2012, "abstract": "The present human gesture measurement approaches have inadequate performance for the environmental universality and the system complex of joint with Multiple Degree of Freedom (MDOF), which result the status of laboratorial measurements, or outdoors with short time and short distance.

Atorvastatin has pleiotropic effects on restraining inflammation and promoting angiogenesis besides its cholesterol-lowering function. Hence, atorvastatin may induce anti-inflammation effects and facilitate therapeutic effects for subdural hematoma (SDH). Methods Adult male Wistar rats were subjected to SDH and successful establishment of SDH was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The treatment was initiated 6 hours after SDH induction. For the treatment, rats suffering SDH were randomly divided into saline group (the control group, rats were treated by saline, n = 29) and atorvastatin group (rats were treated by atorvastatin, 3 mg/kg/day, n = 30). The volume of lesion before treatment as well as on day 2 and day 7 after initial treatment was measured by MRI, respectively. The behaviors before SDH induction and on the days 1, 3, 5 and 7 after the initial treatment were dynamically evaluated. Gene expression, cytokine secretion and the number of neutrophilic granulocyte and vascular density were measured in both neomembrane and SDH lesion on the day 2 and day 7 after the initial treatment. Results It was found that the SDH rats treated by atorvastatin had a better behavior recovery compared to the ones treated by saline (p < 0.05). By virtue of MRI scanning, it was revealed that SDH volumes were eliminated at a high speed by administration of atorvastatin than that of saline. With the help of the microscopic examination in the neomembrane, it was detected that the density of CD31 + neovasculars in the atorvastatin group was significantly higher than that in the saline group and the number of neutrophilic granulocyte in the atorvastatin group is less than that in the saline group. In comparison with saline treatment, the atorvastatin treatment did not change IL-10 expression and secretion, but it significantly decreased TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 level as well as VEGF gene expression. Conclusions Atorvastatin treatment may eliminate SDH and improve the neural function of the rats through its anti-inflammatory effects. Hence, it indicated that statin induced inflammatory modulation might play a significant role in rats' SDH elimination and the functional recovery. \u00a9 2014 The Authors.", "pid": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e15210ddc"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Chuan-Liang Wang", "org": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f5a008"}, {"name": "Ren-Ping Sun", "org": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15119934"}, {"name": "Yong-Ju Chen", "org": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1502b4a3"}, {"name": "Cheng Gong", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Magnetic Resonance and Atomic and Molecular Physics, Wuhan Institute of Physics and Mathematics, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1518ab75"}, {"name": "Xuan-Yang Lai", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Magnetic Resonance and Atomic and Molecular Physics, Wuhan Institute of Physics and Mathematics, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e15050089"}, {"name": "Hui-Peng Kang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Magnetic Resonance and Atomic and Molecular Physics, Wuhan Institute of Physics and Mathematics, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e1510b9ed"}, {"name": "Wei Quan", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Magnetic Resonance and Atomic and Molecular Physics, Wuhan Institute of Physics and Mathematics, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e15160d46"}, {"name": "Xiao-Jun Liu", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Magnetic Resonance and Atomic and Molecular Physics, Wuhan Institute of Physics and Mathematics, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150c0ad2"}], "title": "Above-threshold ionization of xenon by chirped intense laser pulses", "venue": "Chinese Physics Letters", "year": 2014, "abstract": "We experimentally investigate above-threshold ionization of xenon subject to chirped intense laser pulses.

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an in vivo method for mapping white matter fiber tracts in the brain. Objective: To summarize the experience of surgical treatment of brainstem lesions with the assistance of DTI and fiber tractography. Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis clinical data of nine patients with brainstem lesions were investigated between July 2007 and September 2009. The analysis included age distribution, clinical presentation, pre- and postoperative modified Rankin score (mRS), and surgical approach. DTI and fiber tractography were used to reconstruct the corticospinal tracts and the medial lemnisci. Results: DTI and fiber tractography showed that most of the corticospinal tracts were compressed anteriorly or anterolaterally, except for one case (posteriorly). All the medial lemnisci were displaced posteriorly or posterolaterally. Individualized surgical approaches were designed according to the information provided by DTI and fiber tractography. Total resection was achieved in two patients with brainstem cavernomas and two patients with pilocytic astrocytoma. Partial resection was performed in the other patients. The neurological functional status was better than preoperative period in eight patients, one patient with medulla oblongata astrocytoma deteriorated. The preoperative average mRS score was 2.22 points. At the time of the last follow-up, the average postoperative score had improved by 0.56 to 1.66 points.

Initially, the gyro drift estimation error is inaccurate, and the UKF+QUEST mode is adopted to quickly estimate the gyro drifts. When the mean-square error matrix of the UKF tends to stabilization, the information fusion mode is adaptively switched to the UKF+optimal REQUEST dual-filter model. The hybrid simulation results show this method not only has higher accuracy in attitude determination but also can quickly estimate gyro drifts. \u00a9 2008 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.", "pid": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15feba89"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Wei Quan", "org": "School of Instrumentation and Optoelectronics Engineering", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fb95c9"}, {"name": "Jian-Cheng Fang", "org": "School of Instrumentation and Optoelectronics Engineering", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fcf806"}], "title": "A rapid star map identification method based on ant colony clustering algorithm", "keywords": ["Ant colony algorithm", "Clustering analysis", "Guidance star database", "Star map identification"], "venue": "Yuhang Xuebao/Journal of Astronautics", "year": 2008, "abstract": "In order to increase star map identification speed and successful rate for large field of view, a rapid star map identification method based on ant colony clustering algorithm is presented.

The method can realize magnetic compensation in the case where the pumping rate of the probe beam cannot be ignored. In the experiment, the probe beam is always linearly polarized, whereas, the probe beam contains a residual circular component due to the imperfection of the polarizer, which leads to the pumping effect of the probe beam. A simulation of the probe beam's optical rotation and pumping rate was demonstrated. At the optimized points, the wavelength of the probe beam was optimized to achieve the largest optical rotation. Although, there is a small circular component in the linearly polarized probe beam, the pumping rate of the probe beam was non-negligible at the optimized wavelength which if ignored would lead to inaccuracies in the magnetic field compensation. Therefore, the dynamic equation of spin evolution was solved by considering the pumping effect of the probe beam. Based on the quasi-static solution, a novel magnetic compensation method was proposed, which contains two main steps: (1) the non-pumping compensation and (2) the sequence compensation with a very specific sequence. After these two main steps, a three-axis in situ magnetic compensation was achieved. The compensation method was suitable to design closed-loop spin-exchange relaxation-free magnetometer. By a combination of the magnetic compensation and the optimization, the magnetic field sensitivity was approximately 4 fT/Hz ", "pid": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1517c5c7"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Ming Ding", "org": "Optoelectronics Research Centre, University of Southampton", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150d8125"}, {"name": "Michalis N.

The theoretical discussion of our method indicates that the scale factor error introduced by the fluctuation of the cell temperature could be suppressed by setting the optical depth close to one.

To provide good quality of service (QoS) guarantee and reduce energy consuming, some routing protocols in WSN consider link-quality estimation on the routing selection. Most of them consider little with the stability of link quality and the weights of varying. This paper proposed a novel routing selection algorithm in WSN, called integrated link quality estimation-based routing protocol (I-LQER). I-LQER firstly analyzed the energy consuming model, added the different weights for the elements in link-quality estimation, and then established a metric for the stability of link quality. I-LQER considered both the link quality and the stability of link quality to support better QoS. For evaluating the performance of I-LQER, we made extensive simulation experiments in network simulator-2 (NS-2).

Motivated by the urgent needs of crosslayer bandwidth aggregation and the advances of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) in network selection, this paper proposes a novel ACO based cross-layer bandwidth aggregation scheme for efficient Concurrent Multipath data Transfer (CMT-ACO) in wireless transmission. CMT-ACO provides an efficient data delivery with two modules, which are ACO-based Efficiency Aware model (ACO-EA) that devotes to sense paths' transmission efficiency(supported by a cross-layer factor) and reduce \"pingpong\" path switching (enabled by a stabilization factor), and ACO-based Bandwidth Aggregation scheme (ACO-BA) that contributes to provide a cross-layer optimal bandwidth aggregation scheme. The results gained by a close realistic simulation topology show that how CMT-ACO outperforms existing CMT protocol in terms of performance and quality of service in multi-homed SCTP-based wireless networks.

To this end, this paper focuses on the mobility stochastic properties of cognitive radio networks and makes a complete model for them based on the tools of probability theory. In particular, we analyze the mobility stochastic properties of cognitive radio networks under two important mobility models, namely, the Random Direction (RD) model and the Random Waypoint (RWP) model respectively. More specifically, we drive the closed-form expressions of expected meeting time and expected contact time between PU and SU, which can be used to forecast the communication status. To evaluate the accuracy of our models, extensive comparisons are conducted by comparing the theoretical results with the simulation ones under different mobility scenarios.

Methods: HEp-2 cells were infected with C. pn after the culture and propagation of C. pn. The cytopathic effect was observed by microscopy. Morphological characteristics of C. pn inclusions in HEp-2 cells were examined by fluorescence microscopy and acridine orange staining. The ultrastructural changes of C. pn inclusions in the HEp-2 cells were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Cell adhesion assay was performed to investigate the effect of C. pn infection on the adhesion of HEp-2 cells to collagen I. Wound-healing assay and transwell assay were performed to explore the effect of C. pn infection on HEp-2 cell migration. Results: At 72 h post-infection, C. pn infected-HEp-2 cells were swollen and partially desquamated. Numerous vacuoles (inclusions) were observed and C. pn inclusions occupied almost the whole cytoplasm of the HEp-2 cells. Grape-like C. pn inclusions were observed in the HEp-2 cells stained with acridine orange under a fluorescence microscope at 72 h after infection. Under TEM, there were more mature pear-shaped elementary bodies, but less larger and round reticulate bodies in the HEp-2 cells infected with C. pn for 72 h. In the cell adhesion assay, the A value in C. pn infection group was 0.669 \u00b1 0.011, significantly higher than that in the control group (0.558 \u00b1 0.005) at 2 h after infection (P <0.001). The cell adhesion ratio in the C. pn infection group was 119.89%. The migration distance of C. pn infected-HEp-2 cells in the wound-healing assay was significantly longer than that of control cells at 24 h after infection (P < 0.05 ). HEp-2 cells infected with C. pn for 12 h migrated more than the control cells in the transwell assay (23.40 \u00b1 2.41 vs 10.40 \u00b1 1.67) (P < 0.001).

This enhanced cell invasion was strongly suppressed by berberine (50 \u03bcM) (P<0.01). In a cell adhesion assay, the infection-induced HEp-2 cell adhesion to Matrigel was also significantly inhibited by berberine (P<0.01).

Conclusion Our results showed that MLB prevents I/R-induced myocardial damage by reducing necrosis and apoptosis in H9c2 cardiomyocytes and improving myocardial function in rat hearts. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.", "pid": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150a4c2e"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Zhi-Qiang Cao", "org": "Department of Urinary Urology, General Hospital of Shenyang Military Region", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f9807a"}, {"name": "Wei Quan", "org": "Department of Pharmacy, Institute of Mental Health, Xi'An Medical University", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e150594ad"}, {"name": "Shuang-Xing Hou", "org": "Department of Neurology, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e1510548b"}, {"name": "Chao Guo", "org": "Department of Pharmacy, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150c23a4"}, {"name": "Shan-Bo Ma", "org": "Department of Pharmacy, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e1500046c"}, {"name": "Wei Zhang", "org": "Department of Medical Statistics, School of Preventive Medicine, Fourth Military Medical University", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150d776d"}, {"name": "Xin Li", "org": "Department of Urinary Urology, General Hospital of Shenyang Military Region", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15018c66"}], "title": "The natural therapeutic magnesium lithospermate B potently provides neuroprotective effects on cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats", "keywords": ["Akt", "Apoptosis", "Ischemia/reperfusion", "Magnesium lithospermate B", "Salvia miltiorrhiza"], "venue": "Journal of Ethnopharmacology", "year": 2015, "abstract": "Ethnopharmacological relevance Salvia miltiorrhiza, a perennial plant in the genus Salvia and popularly known as \"Danshen\", is highly valued for its roots in traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs). It has widely used for the treatment of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases in China. Recently, the cerebral protection of magnesium lithospermate B (MLB), a working extract from Salvia miltiorrhiza, has received more attention. Here, we investigated the therapeutic effects of MLB on cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (CI/R) injury using the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model in rats. Materials and methods Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to CI/R using a thread to occlude the right middle cerebral artery. After 2 h of cerebral ischemia, the middle cerebral artery was reperfused for 24 h. Rats were injected with different doses of MLB (15, 30 and 60 mg/kg). Infarct zones, neurological deficit scores, brain water content, glutamate levels and protein expressions were evaluated after 24 h of reperfusion. Results We found that MLB treatment of rats exposed to focal CI/R decreased neurological deficit scores, brain water content, glutamate levels and cerebral infarct zones. We also demonstrated that MLB can inhibit CI/R injury-induced activation of caspase-3, a marker of apoptosis. This protection by MLB against CI/R injury was accompanied by an upregulation of p-Akt in the ischemic hemisphere. Furthermore, the MLB-induced protection was prevented by treatment with a PI3K inhibitor (LY-294002). Conclusions The data in the present study suggest a potential protective role of MLB against CI/R injury in rats. The salient finding of the present study is that this protective effect of MLB is likely mediated through an Akt-dependent pathway.", "pid": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e151920b0"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Wei Quan", "org": "Xi'An Mental Health Center, Institute of Mental Health, Xi'An Medical University", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e150594ad"}, {"name": "Feihu Liu", "org": "Xi'An Mental Health Center, Institute of Mental Health, Xi'An Medical University", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150ca9f9"}, {"name": "Yan Zhang", "org": "Xi'An Mental Health Center, Institute of Mental Health, Xi'An Medical University", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1509cfd2"}, {"name": "Congmin Xie", "org": "Xi'An Mental Health Center, Institute of Mental Health, Xi'An Medical University", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f829f6"}, {"name": "Bin Wu", "org": "Xi'An Mental Health Center, Institute of Mental Health, Xi'An Medical University", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151c836b"}, {"name": "Jipeng Yin", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Cancer Biology, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1515521d"}, {"name": "Lei Wang", "org": "Xi'An Mental Health Center, Institute of Mental Health, Xi'An Medical University", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1517ac76"}, {"name": "Wei Zhang", "org": "Department of Medical Statistics, School of Preventive Medicine, Fourth Military Medical University", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151c559b"}, {"name": "Xiaohong Zhang", "org": "Xi'An Mental Health Center, Institute of Mental Health, Xi'An Medical University", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150b64c3"}, {"name": "Qiangju Wu", "org": "Xi'An Mental Health Center, Institute of Mental Health, Xi'An Medical University", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1506141c"}], "title": "Antidepressant-like effects of magnesium lithospermate B in a rat model of chronic unpredictable stress", "keywords": ["Forced swimming test", "Nuclear factor kappa B", "Pro-inflammatory cytokines", "Tail suspension test"], "venue": "Pharmaceutical Biology", "year": 2015, "abstract": "Context: Magnesium lithospermate B (MLB), an active polyphenol acid of Danshen [Radix Salviae miltiorrhizae (Labiatae)], shows neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects in vivo and in vitro. Objective: We hypothesized that MLB might exert antidepressant-like effects by targeting the neuroinflammatory signals. Materials and methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to the chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) protocol. Rats in the control group received no CUS during the whole experiment. In the model group, rats were exposed to CUS for 7 weeks. From the beginning of the 5th week, model group rats were randomly grouped and subjected to different treatments. In the experiment, control and model group rats were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected with saline. MLB was dissolved in saline to give a final concentration, and the rats were injected (i.p.) with 15, 30, or 60 mg/kg MLB once a day for 3 weeks. Results: MLB administration significantly reduced: (1) the immobility time in the forced swimming test (19 s, p < 0.05); (2) the immobility time in the tail suspension test (76.3 s, p < 0.05); (3) the corticosterone (CORT) concentrations in the serum (21.7 nmol/L, p > 0.05); (4) the pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in the serum-TNF-\u03b1 (92.1 pg/ml, p < 0.05), IL-1\u03b2 (86.9 pg/ml, p < 0.05), and IL-6 (93.8 pg/ml, p < 0.05); (5) pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in tissue-TNF-\u03b1 (3.2 pg/mg protein, p < 0.05), IL-1\u03b2 (1.5 pg/mg protein, p > 0.05), and IL-6 (6.3 pg/mg protein, p < 0.05); and (6) phospho-NF-\u03baB (1.6, p < 0.05) and phospho-I\u03baB-\u03b1 (0.4, p < 0.05) expression in tissue.

Sharp eyespot, caused mainly by the soil-borne fungus Rhizoctonia cerealis, is one of the important diseases of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). This disease has escalated into a major threat to wheat production in some regions of the world. Wheat resistance to sharp eyespot can be a potential means to reduce the needs for application of fungicides and agricultural inputs. In the present study, the winter wheat lines, Luke and AQ24788-83, both of which possess quantitative resistance to sharp eyespot, were crossed and a population consisting 241 recombinant-inbred lines (RILs) was constructed. These RILs were assessed for sharp eyespot resistance by conducting five field and greenhouse trials during the period from 2008 to 2012, and they were genotyped with 549 simple-sequence repeat DNA markers. Seven quantitative trait loci (QTL) were detected consistently across the five trial environments to be associated with the sharp eyespot resistance.

Abstract: Leaf rust is an important disease of wheat worldwide. Utilization of slow-rusting resistance constitutes a strategy to sustainably control this disease. The American wheat cultivar Luke exhibits slow leaf-rusting resistance at the adult plant stage. The objectives of this study were to detect and validate QTL for the resistance in Luke. Three winter wheat populations were used, namely, 149 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from the cross Luke\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Aquileja, 307 RILs from Luke\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0AQ24788-83, and 80 F<inf>2:3</inf> families selected from Lingxing66\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0KA298. Aquileja and Lingxing66 are highly susceptible to leaf rust. AQ24788-83 shows high (susceptible) infection type but contains the slow-rusting gene Lr34 as diagnosed by the gene-specific marker cssfr5. KA298, an F<inf>9</inf> RIL selected from Luke\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0AQ24788-83, contains Lr34 and QLr.cau-1AS (a major QTL originated from Luke, this study). These wheats were evaluated for leaf rust in 12 field and greenhouse environments involving four locations and five seasons. Genotyping was done using simple sequence repeat (SSR) and diversity arrays technology markers. Of the detected QTLs, QLr.cau-1AS was significant consistently across all the genetic backgrounds, test environments, and likely a wide range of pathogen races. QLr.cau-1AS explained 22.3\u201355.2\u00a0% of leaf rust phenotypic variation, being comparable to Lr34 in effect size. A co-dominant SSR marker (gpw2246, http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/GG2/index.shtml) was identified to be tightly linked to QLr.cau-1AS. Selection based on gpw2246 for QLr.cau-1AS was as effective as the selection based on cssfr5 for Lr34.

The optimal bias magnetic field, suppression of the disturbance magnetic field in the signal, density ratio of K/Rb, and temperature of the cell are carefully analyzed to make the measurement model precise.", "pid": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150b86c9"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Huipeng Kang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Magnetic Resonance and Atomic and Molecular Physics", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e1510b9ed"}, {"name": "Zhiyang Lin", "org": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e151523af"}, {"name": "Songpo Xu", "org": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15016ed8"}, {"name": "Chuanliang Wang", "org": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f5a008"}, {"name": "Wei Quan", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Magnetic Resonance and Atomic and Molecular Physics", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1505887d"}, {"name": "Xuanyang Lai", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Magnetic Resonance and Atomic and Molecular Physics", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e15050089"}, {"name": "Xiaojun Liu", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Magnetic Resonance and Atomic and Molecular Physics", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150c0ad2"}, {"name": "Xinyan Jia", "org": "Quantum Optoelectronics Laboratory", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fdd1ca"}, {"name": "Xiaolei Hao", "org": "Institute of Applied Physics and Computational Mathematics", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150a86a9"}, {"name": "Jing Chen", "org": "Institute of Applied Physics and Computational Mathematics", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1518762a"}, {"name": "Wei Chu", "org": "Institute of Applied Physics and Computational Mathematics", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1515ab10"}, {"name": "Jinping Yao", "org": "Institute of Applied Physics and Computational Mathematics", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1516ac8c"}, {"name": "Bin Zeng", "org": "Institute of Applied Physics and Computational Mathematics", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1511636e"}, {"name": "Ya Cheng", "org": "Institute of Applied Physics and Computational Mathematics", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15faba4c"}, {"name": "Zhizhan Xu", "org": "State Key Laboratory of High Field Laser Physics", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e151fbd81"}], "title": "Wavelength-dependent ionization suppression of diatomic molecules in intense circularly polarized laser fields", "venue": "Physical Review A - Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics", "year": 2014, "abstract": "We perform an experimental study on comparison between the ionization of homonuclear diatomic molecules (O2 and N2) and their companion atoms (Xe and Ar) radiated by circularly polarized intense laser fields.

Furthermore, protein.protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed by mapping the DEGs into PPI data to identify the pathways that these DEGS are involved in. The results revealed that the expression of 438 DEGs, which are mainly involved in cell death, oxidant reduction, cell cycle and cell.cell signaling, were altered in MCAO samples.

Studies have attempted to determine the risk factors and pathophysiological mechanisms of CSDH using models in numerous mammalian species. To date, these animal models have only been able to reproduce limited durations of hematoma which does not accurately reflect the chronic state of CSDH. To address some of these challenges we modified a rat model of CSDH using two consecutive injections of autologous blood resulting in a hematoma of more than three weeks. We observed inflammatory and angiogenic changes related to the development and recovery of CSDH. In this study the technique for producing a CSDH in a small animal model had a success rate of 78.13%. The hematoma was sustainable up to 24 days. Hematoma resolution was associated with a gradual decrease in local pro-inflammatory factors and gradual increase in anti-inflammatory factors as well as proliferation and subsequent maturation of newly formed vessels. These events were also associated with improved behavioral outcome. Expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines also paralleled reabsorption of the hematoma. Reduction in hematoma size was also associated with neurological recovery. These data suggest that vessel maturation and anti-inflammatory pathways may contribute to the resolution of CSDH and neurological recovery. The regulation of the two mechanisms is a potential target for the treatment of CSDH. The modified model of rat CSDH demonstrated a high level of reproducibility in our hands and may be useful in future CSDH studies.", "pid": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e15044a9a"}]}
