Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-10 participates in the LV remodeling process. However, the intrinsic relationship between CRP and MMP-10 in cardiomyocytes remains unclear. The purpose of this study is to observe whether CRP may promote MMP-10 expression, and if so, to clarify signaling pathways to be involved in CRP-induced MMP-10 expression in cardiomyocytes. We observed in cultured cardiomyocytes that CRP at a dose of 5\u03bcg/ml increased MMP-10 expression and activity in a time-dependent manner, as measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), western blots, and casein zymography analysis. We hypothesized that signal pathways of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and Janus kinases (JAKs)/signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) might be involved in CRP-induced MMP-10 expression. Our results showed that CRP markedly activated c-Raf/MEK/ERK and JAK1/ERK signaling pathways but not JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway by using the phosphor-specific antibodies against these pathways, and blockages of c-Raf/MEK/ERK and JAK1/ERK signaling pathways by the specific ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126 and JAK1 inhibitor piceatannol could significantly decrease CRP-induced MMP-10 expression. In addition, we demonstrated that the DNA binding sites of AP-1 and STAT3 in the nucleus of cardiomyocytes mediated CRP-induced MMP-10 expression. In conclusion, we demonstrated that CRP promoted MMP-10 expression and activity in cardiomyocytes, and clarified that c-Raf/MEK/ERK and JAK1/ERK signaling pathways were involved in MMP-10 expression regulation via activation of DNA binding sites for AP-1 and STAT3 in cardiomyocytes. Our findings suggest that CRP acts as a predictor for LV remodeling might be associated with its promotion effect on MMP-10 expression and activity. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Inc..", "pid": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e15188915"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Qiang Shi", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Polymer Physics and Chemistry", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f9af9a"}, {"name": "Kai-Tak Wan", "org": "Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150e02d6"}, {"name": "Shing-Chung Wong", "org": "Department of Mechanical Engineering", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151d79f7"}, {"name": "Pei Chen", "org": "Department of Mechanical Engineering", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150ece07"}, {"name": "Todd A.

However, alternative analytic methods are needed to confirm this observation, as a single biotin switch method in judging specific protein S-nitrosylation in biological samples is increasingly recognized as insufficient, or even unreliable. Besides, only MGST1 localized on endoplasmic reticulum (ER), but not mitochondria which favors protein S-nitrosylation was examined in the previous report. Present study was therefore carried out to address these issues. Primary cultured hepatocytes were used. A physiological existing nitric oxide (NO) donor S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) was adopted to trigger protein S-nitrosylation. MGST1 was immunoprecipitated and its S-nitrosothiol content was measured by the NO probe 2,3-diaminonaphthalene. In parallel, S-nitrosylated proteins were immunoprecipitated by a monoclonal anti-S-nitrosocysteine antibody and probed with an anti-MGST1 antibody. In hepatocytes, neither ER nor mitochondria were found to contain S-nitrosylated MGST1 after GSNO treatment, showing that differently distributed MGST1 was consistently un-nitrosylable in the cellular environment. But under broken cell conditions, when samples were incubated directly with GSNO, MGST1 S-nitrosylation was indeed detectable in both the microsomal and mitochondrial proteins, indicating that previous failure in detecting MGST1 S-nitrosylation in microsomes is due to the limitations of biotin switch method. These results clearly, if not definitely, demonstrate that MGST1 is not a ready candidate for S-nitrosylation in the cellular content, despite its susceptibility to S-nitrosylation under broken cell conditions. \u00a9 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In the present study we investigated whether the skeletal muscle ALD A shared potential for S-nitrosylation to act as a hypoxiarelated signaling mechanism in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenged rats. Materials and methods: Male Sprague Dawley rats were treated (i.p.) as follows, control group (n = 6) with 0.9% NaCl, tested group (n = 6) with a single dose of 2 mg/kg LPS. Protein S-nitrosylation was determined by biotin switch and dot blotting analysis. ALD A, hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 and vascular endothelial growth factor were determined by western blotting. ALD A catalytic activity treated with S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), an exogenous NO-donor, was examined in vitro. Results: There were several S-nitrosylated proteins under basal conditions. ALD A was over-expressed in a hypoxia-related way in the skeletal muscle of LPS challenged rats. Importantly, treatment of ALD A with GSNO at concentration 50 \u03bcmol/L \u223c 1000 \u03bcmol/L that inhibited catalytic activity, increased the number of S-nitrosylated bands and led to hyper-nitrosylation of basally S-nitrosylated proteins of ALD A. Quantization of enzyme S-nitrosothiol showed that a maximal of four cysteines per subunit was modified by S-nitrosylation in the presence of GSNO. Conclusions: These findings suggested that S-nitrosylation of ALD A might serve as a novel mechanism for controlling ALD A activity at the post-translational level in endotoxemic rats. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Based on KdV, eKdV and MCC theories for internal solitary waves in a two-layer fluid, a theoretical model is established for predicting the internal solitary wave loads on a semi-submersible platform, and the applicability conditions for these internal solitary wave theories are presented in order to apply such a loads model. It is shown that the horizontal loads on the semi-submersible platform due to the internal solitary wave consist of three parts: drag and inertial forces on the vertical column and cross-brace, which can be determined by the Morison formula, as well as Froude-Krylov force on the caisson which can be obtained by integrating the dynamic pressure induced by the internal solitary wave along with the forward and backward surfaces of the caisson respectively. While the vertical load is mainly the vertical Froude-Krylov force which can be calculated by integrating the dynamic pressure along with the upper and lower surfaces of the cross-brace and caisson. Series experimental results show that the drag coefficient in the Morison formula follows some exponential function relationships with the Reynolds, while the inertial force coefficient follows power function relationships with KC numbers. Moreover, the numerical results based on the theoretical predicting model have good agreement with experimental ones.

In a previous paper we considered the importance of accounting for the quantum nature of the dynamics by comparing the linear absorption spectrum and homodyne-detected time-integrated two-pulse photon-echo signal as calculated via the semiclassical forward-backward approach, linearized semiclassical approach, and standard approach which is based on equilibrium ground state dynamics [Shi and Geva, J. Chem. Phys. 122, 064506 (2005)]. In the present paper, we extend the comparison to the case of heterodyne-detected and time-resolved nonlinear time-domain rephasing and nonrephasing signals generated in three-pulse experiments and the corresponding frequency-domain two-dimensional spectra. The comparison is performed in the context of a two-state chromophore solvated in a nonpolar liquid. It is shown that the inherent insensitivity of the standard method to the nonequilibrium dynamics on the excited state potential surface gives rise to two-dimensional spectra which are symmetrical relative to the diagonal. In contrast, accounting for the effect of nonequilibrium excited state dynamics, as is the case within the forward-backward and linearized semiclassical methods, is found to give rise to two-dimensional spectra that become increasingly asymmetrical relative to the diagonal as the waiting time between the second and third pulses becomes larger. It is argued that the emergence of the asymmetry provides a useful probe of nonequilibrium solvation on the excited state potential surface. \u00a9 2008 American Institute of Physics.", "pid": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1514d62f"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Qiang Shi", "org": "State Key Laboratory for Structural Chemistry of Unstable and Stable Species, Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f9af9a"}, {"name": "Pu Liu", "org": "Center for Biophysical Modeling, Simulation and Department of Chemistry, University of Utah", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151bddd8"}, {"name": "Gregory A.

An analytical approximation to the FM short-ranged force is then proposed based on these findings, and the result is numerically tested for liquid water systems. \u00a9 2008 American Chemical Society.", "pid": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e1500700e"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Ren-Hui Zheng", "org": "State Key Laboratory for Structural Chemistry of Unstable and Stable Species", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1507c81d"}, {"name": "Wen-Mei Wei", "org": "Department of Chemistry", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fcab56"}, {"name": "Qiang Shi", "org": "State Key Laboratory for Structural Chemistry of Unstable and Stable Species", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f9af9a"}], "title": "Density functional theory study on sum-frequency vibrational spectroscopy of arabinose chiral solutions", "venue": "Journal of Physical Chemistry A", "year": 2009, "abstract": "Using time-dependent density functional computations we calculate the doubly resonant IR-UV sum-frequency vibrational spectroscopy and sum-frequency vibrational spectroscopy off electronic resonance for D-arabinose solutions.

A modified version of the high temperature approximation to the HEOM gives the best agreement with the exact result. \u00a9 2010 American Institute of Physics.", "pid": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15faa2e8"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Dong Wang", "org": "Department of Chemistry", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f7b339"}, {"name": "Liping Chen", "org": "State Key Laboratory for Structural Chemistry of Unstable and Stable Species", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15021e32"}, {"name": "Renhui Zheng", "org": "State Key Laboratory for Structural Chemistry of Unstable and Stable Species", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1507c81d"}, {"name": "Linjun Wang", "org": "State Key Laboratory for Structural Chemistry of Unstable and Stable Species", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1508793a"}, {"name": "Qiang Shi", "org": "State Key Laboratory for Structural Chemistry of Unstable and Stable Species", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f9af9a"}], "title": "Communications: A nonperturbative quantum master equation approach to charge carrier transport in organic molecular crystals", "venue": "Journal of Chemical Physics", "year": 2010, "abstract": "We present a nonperturbative quantum master equation to investigate charge carrier transport in organic molecular crystals based on the Liouville space hierarchical equations of motion method, which extends the previous stochastic Liouville equation and generalized master equation methods to a full quantum treatment of the electron-phonon coupling.

This suggests that the charge transfer properties of the TTF derivatives can be modified when the number of aromatic rings on TTF skeleton increases. \u00a9 the Owner Societies. 2011.", "pid": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150f444f"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Ren-Hui Zheng", "org": "Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciences", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1507c81d"}, {"name": "Wen-Mei Wei", "org": "Department of Chemistry", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fcab56"}, {"name": "Yuan-Yuan Sun", "org": "Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciences", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150c3823"}, {"name": "Qiang Shi", "org": "Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciences", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f9af9a"}], "title": "Theoretical study of doubly resonant IR-UV hyper-Raman scattering", "venue": "Journal of Physical Chemistry A", "year": 2011, "abstract": "Theoretically we study the doubly resonant IR-UV hyper-Raman scattering where the IR light is resonant to the vibrational transition and the UV/visible light is resonant to the electronic transition between the ground and excited states.

In a previous paper, a semiclassical generalized nonadiabatic transition state theory was used to investigate the nonperturbative effect of the electronic coupling on the charge transport properties, but it is not applicable at low temperatures due to the presence of high-frequency modes from the intramolecular conjugated carbon-carbon stretching vibrations [G. J. Nan et al., J. Chem. Phys., 2009, 130, 024704]. In the present paper, we apply a quantum charge transfer rate formula based on the imaginary-time flux-flux correlation function without the weak electronic coupling approximation. The imaginary-time flux-flux correlation function is then expressed in terms of the vibrational-mode path average and is evaluated by the path integral approach. All parameters are computed by quantum chemical approaches, and the mobility is obtained by kinetic Monte-Carlo simulation. We evaluate the intra-layer mobility of sexithiophene crystal structures in high- and low-temperature phases for a wide range of temperatures. In the case of strong coupling, the quantum charge transfer rates were found to be significantly smaller than those calculated using the weak electronic coupling approximation, which leads to reduced mobility especially at low temperatures. As a consequence, the mobility becomes less dependent on temperature when the molecular packing leads to strong electronic coupling in some charge transport directions. The temperature-independent charge mobility in organic thin-film transistors from experimental measurements may be explained from the present model with the grain boundaries considered. In addition, we point out that the widely used Marcus equation is invalid in calculating charge carrier transfer rates in sexithiophene crystals. \u00a9 2011 the Owner Societies.", "pid": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1509aa48"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Liping Chen", "org": "Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciences", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15021e32"}, {"name": "Renhui Zheng", "org": "Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciences", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1507c81d"}, {"name": "Yuanyuan Jing", "org": "Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciences", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fc5700"}, {"name": "Qiang Shi", "org": "Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciences", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f9af9a"}], "title": "Simulation of the two-dimensional electronic spectra of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex using the hierarchical equations of motion method", "venue": "Journal of Chemical Physics", "year": 2011, "abstract": "We apply the Liouville space hierarchical equations of motion method to calculate the linear and two-dimensional (2D) electronic spectra of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) protein complex from Chlorobium tepidum, using a widely used model Hamiltonian.

A non-monotonic change of the NCEs defined by the peak position of the CO stretch as a function of methanol mole fraction is found, which is ascribed to band asymmetry caused by reorientational dynamics. \u00a9 2012 American Chemical Society.", "pid": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f7a4fb"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Qiang Shi", "org": "School of Physics Science and Information Engineering", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f9af9a"}, {"name": "Junying Zhang", "org": "Department of Physics", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150d670f"}, {"name": "Dong Zhang", "org": "School of Physics Science and Information Engineering", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1518e5bc"}, {"name": "Changzheng Wang", "org": "Institute of Nonferrous Metal Research", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15125a2e"}, {"name": "Bing Yang", "org": "School of Physics Science and Information Engineering", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1508b83e"}, {"name": "Bingyuan Zhang", "org": "School of Physics Science and Information Engineering", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1504a40b"}, {"name": "Wenjun Wang", "org": "School of Physics Science and Information Engineering", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e15105e76"}], "title": "Red luminescent and structural properties of Mg-doped ZnO phosphors prepared by sol-gel method", "keywords": ["Mg-doped ZnO", "Red luminescence", "Sol-gel"], "venue": "Materials Science and Engineering B: Solid-State Materials for Advanced Technology", "year": 2012, "abstract": "Magnesium-doped zinc oxide phosphors with the formula of Mg ", "pid": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151b853f"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Huixue Li", "org": "State Key Laboratory for Structural Chemistry of Unstable and Stable Species", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1512a763"}, {"name": "Renhui Zheng", "org": "State Key Laboratory for Structural Chemistry of Unstable and Stable Species", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1507c81d"}, {"name": "Qiang Shi", "org": "State Key Laboratory for Structural Chemistry of Unstable and Stable Species", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f9af9a"}], "title": "Theoretical study of charge carrier transport in organic semiconductors of tetrathiafulvalene derivatives", "venue": "Journal of Physical Chemistry C", "year": 2012, "abstract": "The density functional theory and hopping model were employed to calculate the charge carrier mobility of four planar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon fused tetrathiafulvalene derivatives.

Halogen substituted TFDQ-TTF and TClDQ-TTF were found to have lower HOMO and LUMO energy levels, such that the electron injection barriers are lowered and the hole injection barriers are elevated. The large transfer integral and small reorganization energy for electron transport also suggest that they have relatively large electron mobilities.

For the PP-g-PEGMA films, it was found that small size protein BSA tended to adsorb on the surface of low molecular weight monomer grafted PP, whereas big spindle-shaped fibrinogen tended to adsorb on the surface of high molecular weight monomer grafted PP. We gave a definition of anti-protein adsorptive factor r with two model proteins, albumin and fibrinogen. The results by platelet adhesion and plasma recalcification time (PRT) experiments indicated that the factor r could be used to quantitatively evaluate the anticoagulant tendency of PP-g-PEGMA modified films. For the PP-g-PEGMA-g-heparin modified films, the surface was proved to have a high bioactivity by the adsorption of AT III assay and very low platelet adhesion.

To provide better understanding of the activity of EpoA against cancers, by theoretical studies such as using docking method, molecular dynamics simulation and density functional theory calculations, we identify several key residues located on \u03b2-tubulin as the active sites to establish an active pocket responsible for interaction with EpoA. Eight residues (Arg276, Asp224, Asp26, His227, Glu27, Glu22, Thr274, and Met363) are identified as the active sites to form the active pocket on \u03b2-tubulin. The interaction energy is predicted to be -121.3 kJ/mol between EpoA and \u03b2-tubulin. In the mutant of \u03b2-tubulin at Thr274Ile, three residues (Arg359, Glu27, and His227) are identified as the active sites for the binding of EpoA. In the mutant of \u03b2-tubulin at Arg282Gln, three residues (Arg276, Lys19, and His227) serve as the active sites. The interaction energy is reduced to 77.2 kJ/mol between EpoA and Arg282Gln mutant and to -50.2 kJ/mol between EpoA and Thr274Ile mutant. The strong interaction with \u03b2-tubulin is significant to EpoA's activity against cancer cells. When \u03b2-tubulin is mutated either at Arg282Gln or at Thr274Ile, the decreased strength of interaction explains the activity reduced for EpoA. Therefore, this work shows that the structural basis of the active pocket plays an important role in regulating the activity for EpoA with a Taxol-like mechanism of action to be promoted as an antitumor agent. \u00a9 2012 Taylor & Francis.", "pid": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f95872"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Zhenzhen Xu", "org": "Graduate University Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f54b77"}, {"name": "Qing Liao", "org": "Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciences (BNLMS)", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e151474ae"}, {"name": "Qiang Shi", "org": "Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciences (BNLMS)", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f9af9a"}, {"name": "Haoli Zhang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Applied Organic Chemistry", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ff2467"}, {"name": "Jiannian Yao", "org": "Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciences (BNLMS)", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1518cca4"}, {"name": "Hongbing Fu", "org": "Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciences (BNLMS)", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1505bc17"}], "title": "Low-threshold nanolasers based on slab-nanocrystals of H-aggregated organic semiconductors", "keywords": ["H-aggregates", "lasers", "nanowires", "organic semiconductors", "photonics"], "venue": "Advanced Materials", "year": 2012, "abstract": "Low-threshold nanolasers based on slab nanocrystals (SNCs) of highly emissive H-aggregated organic semiconductors are reported.

The exploration and transportation processes of CBM were simulated under the condition of the complicated stresses. The relationships among effective stress, desorption character, and seepage character were presented. The relationship expressions were studied. Some novel interaction laws were obtained as follows: (1) the variation laws among desorption quality, desorption time and effective stress all have negative exponential decrement relationship, and the relationship is not correlated with the loading method. (2) a cut-off point in the effective stress exists, and the desorption quality and time will increase rapidly with the increase of effective stress when it is smaller than the cut-off point value. On the contrary, the increase extent will become smaller. For the Sun sample No.2, the cut-off point value is about 3.0 MPa. (3) a critical effective stress (such as critical desorption pressure) is found. The desorption quantity and time will be approached to zero when the effective stress is larger than the critical value. The critical value is about 10.0 MPa for Sun sample No.2. (4) in the loading processes, the relationship curves among effective stress, permeability and permeability coefficient show positive exponential decrement. This above indicates that the adsorption of CBM is the main control factor for the scope of smaller effective stress in the process of pore pressure increase.

Methods: Polylactide coglycotide (PLGA)-heparin complex was sprayed to the surface of sirolimus-coated nitinol stent to make the sirolimus-heparin eluting stent (SHES). The physical and degrading efficiency, blood compatibility, and pharmacokinetics of this stent were studied in vitro. Fifteen dogs were implanted with SHES + bare-metal stent (BMS) into the bilateral iliac arteries (n = 4), sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) + BMS into the bilateral iliac arteries (n = 4), SHES + SES into the bilateral iliac arteries (n = 4), and with 2 SHESs into the bilateral iliac arteries (n = 2), and 2 SHESs into the abdominal aorta (n = 1). Based on the condition of strict anticoagulation, 30, 60, and 240 days after the implantation angiography of the peripheral arteries where the stents were placed was performed in 7, 7, and 1 dog respectively. Then all of the dogs were killed. The compliance, radial force, and visibility of stent, in-stent thrombosis, in-stent diameter, reference segment diameter, late loss of diameter, and restenosis rate were observed. Results: The SHES had even surface coating, and good compliance and radial extension. Blood compatibility test showed only few platelets adhered to the stent surface without deformity or obvious aggregation, and the clotting time was prolonged because of the blood coagulation factors to be activated in a low level. Degrading test and pharmacokinetics in vitro showed that sirolimus could be continuously released in a period of 3 months and heparin in a period of 50 day. The whole 30 stents were successfully implanted into the dog peripheral arteries without complication. The SHES showed satisfactory compliance and good visibility, and its blood concentration of sirolimus was 1.79 - 2.22 ng/ml immediately after stent implantation, 0.4 ng/ml 7 d later, and its release could be continuous about 3 months. Angiography 30 days after the implantation showed no thrombosis and intimal hyperplasia. Angiography 60 days after the implantation showed 2 cases of SES obstruction due to in-stent thrombosis, 1 case of SHES stricture and 3 cases of BMS stricture resulted from intimal hyperplasia, and 1 case of mild sinking of the arterial lumen proximate to the SHES. There were significant differences in the in-stent diameter and its late loss value between the SHES,SES, and bare stent(F:0.049, P < 0.05; F:0.047, P < 0.05). 240 days after the implantation two SHESs placed in bilateral iliac arteries of a dog were un-obstructed.

Methods: Human proximal renal tubular epithelial cells (HK-2) were subjected to A/R with or without glutamine, after which viability and apoptosis of the cells were determined by MTT assay and annexin V flow cytometry, respectively. Meanwhile, expression of HO-1, caspase-3, Bcl-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS) was measured by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. Results: A/R significantly induced apoptosis of HK-2 cells, which was inhibited by glutamine, during which HO-1 was upregulated significantly, but nullified by p38MAPK inhibitor. Caspase-3 and iNOS increased after A/R; however, glutamine inhibited this potential. Opposite results were observed for Bcl-2. Conclusion: Glutamine prevents A/R injury of HK-2 cells through induction of HO-1 via a p38MAPK-dependent pathway, which plays a key role in the cytoprotective effect of glutamine.

We thus investigated its in vivo tissue-protective effect in a rat liver ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) model. Methods: Before the I/R procedure, animals were treated with glutamine. Liver injury was evaluated by serum liver enzymes, histological examination and apoptosis detection by transferase-mediated uridine nick end labeling staining. Meanwhile, expression and activities of HO-1 were measured by Western blot and a biochemical method. Liver blood flow was measured by using a laser Doppler flowmeter, and oxidative injury was investigated by the thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance (TBARS) assay. The inflammatory cytokine monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 was quantified by ELISA. Results: I/R caused a large increase in levels of liver enzymes, remarkably inducing the necrosis and apoptosis of liver tissue, which was markedly inhibited by glutamine, during which HO-1 was upregulated significantly, and the HO-1 inhibitor zinc protoporphyrin nullified the effect of glutamine. Liver blood flow was greatly reduced after I/R; however, it was significantly improved by glutamine. Lipid peroxidation (TBARS) in liver tissue was largely induced which was significantly lowered by glutamine. Similar results were also observed for the production of MCP-1.

The suture sites of group C were packed with bFGF compound degradative membrane, but the group D was not. 2 On postoperative days 56, 90 and 180, the transplantation sites were excised for HE staining, Mallory, myelin staining section, Luzex-F image pattern analysis instrument determination, quantitative determination of peripheral joint of far near nerve suture segment and electro-physiological index examination. Results: 1 Visual inspection and observation under microscope: The surface of transplanted nerve segment in group A and C encapsulated by bFGF compound degradative membrane was more smooth than group B and D. Compared with the other groups, the proliferation of connective tissue in the proximal and distal end of transplanted segment in group A was evidently less. 2 Restoration of blood-nerve barrier function in group A was obviously improved compared with group B. 3 Luzex-F image analysis examination showed that the number of the regenerated myelinated neurofibers in group A and C was more than that in group B and D (t=-4.714 3 to -6.453 4, P 0.01), and the number in group B was more than that in group D. 4 Quantitative determination of peripheral near nerve suture segment suggested that group A had less adhesion to peripheral tissues than group B (P < 0.05). 5 Electrophysiological index: The latency of group B was longer latency than that of group A (t=5.467 5, P < 0.001), but the amplitude was lower than that of group A (t=4.335 0, P < 0.05). Conclusion: 1 bFGF compound degradative membrane and the recipient plasma treatment could improve neural regeneration. 2 The combined usage of immersion of heterogeneous nerve in recipient plasma and treatment before freezing, following by implantation of bFGF and degradative membrane could better promote neural regeneration.", "pid": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1506aadb"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Feng-Yan Zhang", "org": "School of Highway", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e1500ba6a"}, {"name": "Qiang Shi", "org": "Chinese First Institute Limited Corporation of Highway Survey and Design", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150e93b2"}, {"name": "Yuan-Qing Wang", "org": "School of Highway", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151e059b"}], "title": "Classification of highway maintenance works", "keywords": ["Classification", "Cost management", "Highway maintenance", "Road engineering"], "venue": "Chang'an Daxue Xuebao (Ziran Kexue Ban)/Journal of Chang'an University (Natural Science Edition)", "year": 2008, "abstract": "According the characteristics of expressway, common highway and rural highway, this paper studied the classification of highway maintenance works.

It is being used for muscularis propria tumors of the digestive tract and has produced positive therapeutic effects. Objective: To study the feasibility of ESD for the removal of esophageal muscularis propria tumors and to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ESD for this treatment. Design: Single-center, retrospective study. Setting: University hospital. Patients: Thirty esophageal muscularis propria tumors from 28 patients were treated with ESD between December 2008 and December 2010. We defined esophageal muscularis propria tumors as esophageal submucosal tumors originating from the muscularis propria layer. Intervention: ESD. Main Outcome Measurements: Tumor characteristics, complications, en bloc resection rate, and local recurrence rate were evaluated. Results: Among the 28 patients, 11 were women (39.3%). The median age was 49.32 years (range 22-62 years). Mean (\u00b1SD) tumor size was 1.25 \u00b1 0.70 cm (range 0.5-3.0 cm). Except for 2 failed cases (one changed to surgery and the other changed to nylon ligation), 26 cases with 28 tumors (2 cases had 2 tumors) originating from the muscularis propria of the esophagus were successfully resected by ESD. The en bloc resection rate was 93.3% (28/30). The median ESD procedure time was 73.5 minutes (range 30-120 minutes). Perforation occurred in 2 cases during dissection of the lesion, which was closed with metal endoclips. Pneumothorax occurred after the treatment in both cases. Closed thoracic drainages were initiated, and the patients recovered quickly without surgery. Pathological examination confirmed 27 leiomyomas and 1 GI stromal tumor. The curative resection rate was 100% (28/28). There was no recurrence during a 3 to 27month follow-up period. Limitations: The limitation of the study was its retrospective design. Conclusion: ESD offers the promise of localized treatment of esophageal muscularis propria tumors with relatively few complications and low mortality.

The traditional management option was close follow-up and surgical tumor resection. With the development of endoscopy devices and techniques, endoscopic resection is considered an alternative treatment option. However, whether small lesions require treatment has been controversial. We planned to study the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of endoscopic resection for the treatment of Brunner's adenomas. Subjects and Methods: In total, 30 Brunner's adenomas from 29 patients were treated with endoscopic resection between August 2007 and June 2011 in our hospital. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) was performed preoperatively to evaluate tumor origin and size. Tumor characteristics, complications, en bloc resection rate, and local recurrence rates were evaluated. Results: Of the 29 patients, 13 (44.8%) were men. The median age was 55 years (range, 29-72 years). The mean maximal dimension of the lesions was 1.7\u00b10.1? cm (range, 0.6-7? cm). Overall, 9 lesions were treated with snare resection, 12 lesions were treated with conventional endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR), and 9 lesions were treated with endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). Only 1 case of delayed bleeding occurred on Day 2 after EMR. The en bloc resection rate was 100% (30/30). One lesion resected by EMR exhibited indeterminate tumor margins. The overall curative resection rate was 96.7% (29/30). During the follow-up period (median time, 13 months; range, 2-39 months), 1 patient, whose tumor exhibited indeterminate margins, showed recurrence 1 year after EMR; ESD was recommended. No recurrence was observed during the subsequent follow-up period. Conclusions: Our study provides evidence of the efficacy of endoscopic resection for the localized treatment of duodenal Brunner's gland adenomas with relatively few complications and a low mortality rate. \u00a9 Copyright 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2012.", "pid": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151dafa8"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Qiang Shi", "org": "Endoscopy Center and Endoscopy Research Institute", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15015f5c"}, {"name": "Mei-Dong Xu", "org": "Endoscopy Center and Endoscopy Research Institute", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1513e7f8"}, {"name": "Yun-Shi Zhong", "org": "Endoscopy Center and Endoscopy Research Institute", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1514ebdf"}, {"name": "Ping-Hong Zhou", "org": "Endoscopy Center and Endoscopy Research Institute", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1501b8d1"}, {"name": "Hai-Fu Wu", "org": "Endoscopy Center and Endoscopy Research Institute", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f8c6d1"}, {"name": "Li-Qing Yao", "org": "Endoscopy Center and Endoscopy Research Institute", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f67342"}], "title": "The laparoscopic-endoscopic cooperative surgery for the colonic calcifying fibrous tumor: One case report", "venue": "Journal of Laparoendoscopic and Advanced Surgical Techniques", "year": 2012, "abstract": "The calcifying fibrous tumor (CFT) is classified as a benign fibrous lesion, and it is a rare pathologic entity.

Methods: From April 2008 to April 2012, surgeryrelated parameters, complications, overall survival (OS), and disease-free survival (DFS) of 74 consecutive patients with left-sided CRC presented with ACO who underwent self-expandable metallic stent (SEMS) placement followed by one-stage open (n = 58) or laparoscopic resection (n = 16) were evaluated retrospectively. The stent-laparoscopy group was also compared with a control group of 96 CRC patients who underwent regular laparoscopy without ACO between January 2010 and December 2011 to explore whether SEMS placement influenced the laparoscopic procedure or reduced long-term survival by influencing CRC oncological characteristics. Results: The characteristics of patients among these groups were comparable. The rate of conversion to open surgery was 12.5% in the stent-laparoscopy group. Bowel function recovery and postoperative hospital stay were significantly shorter (3.3 \u00b1 0.9 d vs 4.2 \u00b1 1.5 d and 6.7 \u00b1 1.1 d vs 9.5 \u00b1 6.7 d, P = 0.016 and P = 0.005), and surgical time was significantly longer (152.1 \u00b1 44.4 min vs 127.4 \u00b1 38.4 min, P = 0.045) in the stent-laparoscopy group than in the stent-open group. Surgery-related complications and the rate of admission to the intensive care unit were lower in the stent-laparoscopy group. There were no significant differences in the interval between stenting and surgery, intraoperative blood loss, OS, and DFS between the two stent groups. Compared with those in the stentlaparoscopy group, all surgery-related parameters, complications, OS, and DFS in the control group were comparable. Conclusion: The stent-laparoscopy approach is a feasible, rapid, and minimally invasive option for patients with ACO caused by left-sided CRC and can achieve a favorable long-term prognosis. \u00a9 2013 Baishideng.

Advances in identification of novel mechanisms are therefore in an urgent need to fill the gap of our knowledge in CRC development. Here, we performed both in vitro and in vivo experiments along with in silico analysis to identify a new regulatory circuit that stimulated CRC tumorigenesis. In this report, we, for the first time, analyzed the correlation of FIH-1 level with clinicopathological features of CRC. The finding that FIH-1 was not only significantly decreased in tumor tissue as compared with the adjacent normal tissue but also was significantly correlated with tumor T stage status, indicated the role of FIH-1 as a tumor suppressor in CRC development. Moreover, we found the expression of miR-31, a short non-coding RNA which played a critical role in CRC development, was negatively correlated with FIH-1 expression in CRC samples and cell lines. Together with the result from luciferase report assay, it was demonstrated that miR-31 could directly regulate FIH-1 expression in CRC. This miR-31/FIH-1 nexus was further shown to control cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro and to control tumor growth in vivo. Additionally, correlation of the miR-31 expression with clinicopathologic features in CRC samples was examined in support of the driving role of newly identified miR-31/FIH-1 nexus in CRC tumorigenesis. These findings highlight the critical role of miR-31/FIH-1 nexus in CRC and reveal the contribution of miR-31 to CRC development by targeting FIH-1. \u00a9 2014 Landes Bioscience.", "pid": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f6a09c"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Qiang Shi", "org": "Endoscopy Center, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15015f5c"}, {"name": "Hui Ju", "org": "Department of Gastroenterology, Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e15145229"}, {"name": "Li-Qing Yao", "org": "Endoscopy Center, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f67342"}, {"name": "Ping-Hong Zhou", "org": "Endoscopy Center, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1501b8d1"}, {"name": "Mei-Dong Xu", "org": "Endoscopy Center, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1513e7f8"}, {"name": "Tao Chen", "org": "Endoscopy Center, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f60843"}, {"name": "Jia-Min Zhou", "org": "Endoscopy Center, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ff97d1"}, {"name": "Tian-Yin Chen", "org": "Endoscopy Center, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150d1b61"}, {"name": "Yun-Shi Zhong", "org": "Endoscopy Center, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1514ebdf"}], "title": "Risk factors for postoperative stricture after endoscopic submucosal dissection for superficial esophageal carcinoma", "venue": "Endoscopy", "year": 2014, "abstract": "Background and study aims: Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is accepted as an established treatment modality for superficial esophageal carcinoma (SEC).

A total of 362 patients with SEC treated by ESD at Zhongshan Hospital, Shanghai, were enrolled between January 2007 and February 2012. Demographic and clinical parameters, including patient-, lesion-, and procedure-related factors, were analyzed for postoperative stricture risk factors. Results: The postoperative stricture rate was 11.6 % (42/362). The mean and median time from ESD to stricture was 58.5 \u00b1 12.3 days (range 21 - 90 days) and 28 days, respectively. Mild, median, and severe stricture were observed in 16.7 % (7/42), 38.1 % (16 /42), and 45.2 % (19/42) of patients, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that circumferential extension of > 3/4 (odds ratio [OR] 44.2, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 4.4 - 443.6) and the depth of invasion above m2 (OR 14.2, 95 %CI 2.7 - 74.2) were independent risk factors for stricture.

It indicates that the arc ignites due to the self-pinch effect, which starts from the free surface of liquid metal and develops in the form of gas cavities. According to the analysis of the subsequent stage after arc ignition, it can be concluded that the arc plasma should be a mixture of metal vapor and air. With the morphological changes of the arc, the arc evolution can be classified into four stages. The arc erosion on electrodes is observed during the arc process, and its causes are analyzed in detail. Using a liquid metal current-limiting device, the arc characteristics during the current limitation are investigated. It is found that the duration of the prearcing stage and the arc voltage are influenced by the pass-through current. As prospective current increases, the prearcing time reduces because of the acceleration of the pinch process and the arc voltage rise due to the adequate arc burning. \u00a9 2010 IEEE.", "pid": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fbbb41"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Fei Yang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Electrical Insulation and Power Equipment", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150f8938"}, {"name": "Mingzhe Rong", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Electrical Insulation and Power Equipment", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e151718d9"}, {"name": "Yi Wu", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Electrical Insulation and Power Equipment", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150cceb4"}, {"name": "Anthony B.

Methods: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of lutein supplementation was conducted in healthy nonsmokers. 117 eligible subjects were randomly assigned to receive 10 or 20 mg/d of lutein or placebo for 12 weeks. Levels of plasma carotenoid concentrations, total antioxidant capacity (TAOC), the lipoprotein profile, and antioxidant enzymes activities were determined at baseline and at 6, and 12 weeks after the initiation of treatment. Biomarkers of oxidative damage to protein and lipids, and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations were measured at baseline and after supplementation. Results: Plasma lutein and TAOC significantly increased in both active treatment groups during 12 weeks. A significant reduction was found in malondialdehyde in the 20 mg lutein group. CRP concentration decreased in a dose-dependent manner for lutein supplementation, and there was a significant between-group difference in CRP between the 20 mg lutein and the placebo group. Serum CRP was directly related to the change in plasma lutein and TAOC for both active treatment groups. Conclusion: The results support the possibility that lutein supplementation reduce biomarkers of CVD risk via decreased lipid peroxidation and inflammatory response by increasing plasma lutein concentrations and antioxidant capacity. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.", "pid": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1512696a"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Hailong He", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Electrical Insulation and Power Equipment", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1511212b"}, {"name": "Mingzhe Rong", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Electrical Insulation and Power Equipment", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e151718d9"}, {"name": "Yi Wu", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Electrical Insulation and Power Equipment", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150cceb4"}, {"name": "Fei Yang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Electrical Insulation and Power Equipment", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150f8938"}, {"name": "Yiying Liu", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Electrical Insulation and Power Equipment", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f4e060"}, {"name": "Jiajian Man", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Electrical Insulation and Power Equipment", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1505e615"}, {"name": "Jinhua Luo", "org": "Wuhan Marine Electric Propulsion Research Institute", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e151018ae"}, {"name": "Qiang Shi", "org": "State Grid Laboratory of Instrument Transformer", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ff687c"}], "title": "Experimental research and analysis of a novel liquid metal fault current limiter", "keywords": ["Arc behavior", "fault current limiters (FCLs)", "GaInSn liquid metal", "pressure measurement"], "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery", "year": 2013, "abstract": "This paper deals with the experimental research on a novel current limiter, which mainly takes advantage of the gas pressure in the liquid metal when arcing.

Furthermore, a specially designed setup is employed to observe the moving process of the sliding part along with the arc behavior.

We aimed to conduct a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies to examine the association between dietary lutein and zeaxanthin intake and risk of age-related cataract (ARC). Methods: We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases up to March 2013. Reference lists from retrieved articles were also reviewed. The adjusted relative risks (RRs) from each study were extracted to calculate a pooled estimate with its 95 % confidence interval (CI). The dose-response relationships were assessed by using generalized least-squares trend estimation. Results: Six prospective cohort studies were identified involving 4,416 cases and 41,999 participants. For the comparison between the highest and the lowest categories of dietary lutein and zeaxanthin intake, significant inverse association were found for nuclear cataract (RR: 0.75; 95 % CI: 0.65, 0.85), but not for cortical cataract (RR: 0.85; 95 % CI: 0.53, 1.17) and for posterior subcapsular cataract (RR: 0.77; 95 % CI: 0.40, 1.13). Dose-response analysis showed that every 300 \u03bcg/d increment in dietary lutein and zeaxanthin intake was associated with a 3 %, 1 %, or 3 % reduction in the risk of nuclear cataract (RR: 0.97; 95 % CI: 0.94, 0.99), cortical cataract (RR: 0.99; 95 % CI: 0.95, 1.02), or posterior subcapsular cataract (RR: 0.97; 95 % CI: 0.93, 1.01) respectively. Conclusions: Dietary lutein and zeaxanthin intake is associated with a reduced risk of ARC, especially nuclear cataract in a dose-response manner, indicating a beneficial effect of lutein and zeaxanthin in ARC prevention. \u00a9 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.", "pid": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fee334"}, {"authors": [{"name": "David L.

In addition, we tested its effects under normal conditions as well as under inflammatory conditions induced by tumour necrosis factor- \u03b1 (TNF- \u03b1) administered either by cotreatment, pretreatment, or posttreatment. Immunocytochemistry, MTT, wound-healing, and flow cytometry assays were performed. The resveratrol treatment significantly enhanced BAEC proliferation and attenuated TNF- \u03b1 -induced impairment of proliferation at the optimal doses of 1-50 \u03bcM. Resveratrol at a high dose (100 M) and TNF- \u03b1 impaired BAEC migration, while low doses of resveratrol (1-50 M) attenuated TNF- \u03b1 -induced impairment of BAEC migration. Moreover, resveratrol inhibited TNF- \u03b1 -induced ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression. Taken together, our results suggest that the resveratrol protects BAECs after inflammatory stimulation as well as ameliorates inflammatory effects at low concentrations. Consequently, resveratrol should be considered as a candidate drug for the prevention and treatment of inflammatory vascular diseases. \u00a9 2013 Juan Xiao et al.", "pid": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e150739dd"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Jin-Hu Ma", "org": "Agronomy College", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f592d2"}, {"name": "Shu-Jin Guo", "org": "Agronomy College", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e15074838"}, {"name": "Yuguo Wang", "org": "Agronomy College", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15faf4fa"}, {"name": "Xiao-Huan Yang", "org": "Agronomy College", "id": "5b5433e3e1cd8e4e15f47dcb"}, {"name": "Qiang Shi", "org": "Agronomy College", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fb87d4"}], "title": "Effects of seed priming on biomass allocation and osmotic substance contents of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) seedlings under salt stress", "keywords": ["Biomass allocation", "Osmotic substance", "Salt stress", "Seed priming", "Sorghum"], "venue": "Chinese Journal of Ecology", "year": 2010, "abstract": "Taking two sorghum hybridized combinations Tx623Ax89-363 and Hei30AxDalizao as test materials, 100 mmol \u00b7 L", "pid": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e1510995a"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Jianjun Chen", "org": "Key Laboratory of Advanced Textile Materials and Manufacturing Technology", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e1520f81a"}, {"name": "Qiang Shi", "org": "Key Laboratory of Advanced Textile Materials and Manufacturing Technology", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151b0eec"}, {"name": "Linhui Gao", "org": "Center of Materials Engineering", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151ba4be"}, {"name": "Hongliang Zhu", "org": "Center of Materials Engineering", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fd0834"}], "title": "Large-scale synthesis of ultralong single-crystalline SiC nanowires", "keywords": ["microstructure", "nanowires", "semiconductors", "SiC", "vapor-solid growth"], "venue": "Physica Status Solidi (A) Applications and Materials Science", "year": 2010, "abstract": "A large number of cotton-like ultralong \u03b2-SiC nanowires (NWs) were successfully synthesized via a simple catalyst-free carbothermal reduction approach using a carbonaceous silica xerogel as raw materials.

Several studies have illustrated that pirfenidone (5-methyl-1-phenyl-2-[1H]-pyridone) attenuates cardiac fibrosis in different animal models. However, the effects of pirfenidone on cardiac fibroblast behavior have not been examined. In this study, we investigated whether pirfenidone directly modulates cardiac fibroblast behavior that is important in myocardial remodeling such as proliferation, myofibroblast differentiation, migration and cytokine secretion. Fibroblasts were isolated from neonatal rat hearts and bioassays were performed to determine the effects of pirfenidone on fibroblast function. We demonstrated that treatment of CFs with pirfenidone resulted in decreased proliferation, and attenuated fibroblast \u03b1-smooth muscle actin expression and collagen contractility. Boyden chamber assay illustrated that pirfenidone inhibited fibroblast migration ability, probably by decreasing the ratio of matrix metalloproteinase-9 to tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1. Furthermore, pirfenidone attenuated the synthesis and secretion of transforming growth factor-\u03b21 but elevated that of interleukin-10. These direct and pleiotropic effects of pirfenidone on cardiac fibroblasts point to its potential use in the treatment of adverse myocardial remodeling. \u00a9 2011 Shi et al.", "pid": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1510dc5d"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Xiaoyan Liu", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Disease", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f493eb"}, {"name": "Liukun Meng", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Disease", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f5f2ce"}, {"name": "Qiang Shi", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Disease", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150a481d"}, {"name": "Shenghua Liu", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Disease", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e15062acf"}, {"name": "Chuanjue Cui", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Disease", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1508bbba"}, {"name": "Shengshou Hu", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Disease", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e15193e5c"}, {"name": "Yingjie Wei", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Disease", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151c325c"}], "title": "Dermatopontin promotes adhesion, spreading and migration of cardiac fibroblasts in vitro", "keywords": ["Dermatopontin (DPT)", "Myocardial infarction", "Ventricular remodeling"], "venue": "Matrix Biology", "year": 2013, "abstract": "Dermatopontin (DPT), an extracellular matrix (ECM) protein, has been previously shown to be upregulated in the infarct zone of experimentally induced myocardial infarction (MI) rats.

Further, we tested the possible roles of DPT in CFs adhesion, spreading, migration and proliferation, which greatly promote the ventricular remodeling process after MI. Results showed that hypoxia/SD stimulated DPT expression and secretion in CMs and CFs and that DPT promoted adhesion, spreading and migration of CFs whereas had no effect on CFs proliferation. In addition, functional blocking antibodies specific for integrin \u03b13 and \u03b21 significantly reduced CFs adhesion and migration that DPT induced, suggesting that integrin \u03b13\u03b21 is at least one receptor for CFs adhesion and migration to DPT.

To develop blood-contacting biomaterials with long-term antihemolysis capability, we present a facile method to construct a hydrophilic, 3D hierarchical architecture on the surface of styrene-b-(ethylene-co-butylene) -b-styrene elastomer (SEBS) with poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)/lecithin nano/microfibers. The strategy is based on electrospinning of PEO/lecithin fibers onto the surface of poly [poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate] [P(PEGMEMA)]-modified SEBS, which renders SEBS suitable for RBC storage in vitro. We demonstrate that the constructed 3D architecture is composed of hydrophilic micro- and nanofibers, which transforms to hydrogel networks immediately in blood; the controlled release of lecithin is achieved by gradual dissolution of PEO/lecithin hydrogels, and the interaction of lecithin with RBCs maintains the membrane flexibility and normal RBC shape. Thus, the blood-contacting surface reduces both mechanical and oxidative damage to RBC membranes, resulting in low hemolysis of preserved RBCs.

Establishing a facile method to understand the platelet adhesion and assess the platelet function through the mechanism and mechanics of adhesion is highly desired.

Our study demonstrated that the patterned surface facilitated probing of single platelet adhesion in a quantitative manner, and rendered platelets sensitive to adhesive proteins even at a low protein concentration. In addition, the platelet function in the presence of antiplatelet (anticancer) agents on platelets could be accurately estimated based on single platelet adhesion (SPA).

Experimental results recorded a measurement resolution lower than 0.4 kPa and a measurement speed of eight times per second. \u00a9 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.", "pid": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1512d313"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Qiang Shi", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Transducer Technology, Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1518d133"}, {"name": "Junbo Wang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Transducer Technology, Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f9e199"}, {"name": "Deyong Chen", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Transducer Technology, Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1506bdfe"}, {"name": "Jian Chen", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Transducer Technology, Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150b12c6"}, {"name": "Jing Li", "org": "Department of Gastroenterology, Peking University People\u2019s Hospital", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e151650f7"}, {"name": "Kaikai Bao", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Transducer Technology, Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150f0d3b"}], "title": " In Vitro and In Vivo characterization of wireless and passive micro system enabling gastrointestinal pressure monitoring", "keywords": ["Animal Testing", "BioMEMS", "Gastrointestinal Pressure", "Inductive Coupling", "Wireless and Passive Pressure Sensor"], "venue": "Biomedical Microdevices", "year": 2014, "abstract": "This paper presents a wireless and passive micro pressure system based on the LC mutual inductance detection mechanism for gastrointestinal (GI) pressure monitoring. The micro pressure system is composed of a sensor capsule (a pressure sensitive micro capacitive sensor in series with an induction coil to form an LC tank) and a detection unit (a detection coil connected with a network analyzer). The pressure variations under measurement lead to changes in the capacitance of the pressure sensor and therefore a shift in the LC tank resonant frequency, quantified by the impedance measurement of the detection coil. The pressure sensor was fabricated using microfabrication processes with key parameters optimized. The in vitro characterization of the micro pressure system recorded a sensitivity of 0.2491\u00a0kHz/kPa (\u221210 kPa to 30 kPa). One-month rabbit stomach pressure monitoring was conducted based on the developed micro pressure system as a confirmation of device long term in vivo stability. Furthermore, rabbit stomach pressure variations before and after food feeding was recorded and compared where three distinctive contraction patterns (random contraction with low amplitude, irregular strong contractions and regular contraction in a cyclic manner) following food feeding were located. Compared to previous reported GI pressure sensors, this LC tank is featured with simple device structure without batteries and electrical components for energy transfer. Both in vitro and in vivo characterization confirm the functionality of the system, which may enable the gastrointestinal motility study in the near future.", "pid": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150fd5dd"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Hu Gong", "org": "National Engineering Research Center for Multimedia", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e15077cef"}, {"name": "Qiang Shi", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Survering Mapping and Remote Sensing", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1506eaaa"}], "title": "Spatial enhancement of DEM using perspective non-Lambertian SFS from multi-spectral image", "keywords": ["Component", "DEM densification", "Heterogeneous area", "Interpolation", "Perspective non-lambertian model", "Shape from shading"], "venue": "2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing, WiCOM 2012", "year": 2012, "abstract": "Numerous geosciences applications need denser and more accurate Digital Elevation Model data. Photogrammetry, as the main method of producing DEM, sometimes loses its feasibility in the textureless area or in the case where no aerial photography with highly spatial resolution is available. Under this circumstance, interpolation methods are often utilized to generate denser DEM map. However, these methods are mathematical processes which only consider known points and neglect the ground truth of unknown surface. To correctly reconstruct the surface of terrain from sparse ground control points, this paper presents a new DEM densification algorithm, combining perspective non- Lambertian SFS based on spectral information from single satellite image with DEM interpolation. Single multi-spectral image was used to correctly estimate surface reflection properties at first, and surface relative shape was reconstructed based on Oren-Nayar reflection model. Finally the shape from gradient interpolation method was applied to generate a higher-resolution DEM grid. Experiments demonstrate the ability of the proposed algorithm for the enhanced resolution DEM map from the sparse DEM grid and multi-spectral image. \u00a9 2012 IEEE.", "pid": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f51072"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Bing Yang", "org": "School of Physics Science and Information Technology", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1508b83e"}, {"name": "Ruixin Dong", "org": "School of Physics Science and Information Technology", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fa8366"}, {"name": "Xunling Yan", "org": "School of Physics Science and Information Technology", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f51ecd"}, {"name": "Qiang Shi", "org": "School of Physics Science and Information Technology", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1511ad5d"}], "title": "Recognizing nucleosides with transverse electronic transport via perpendicular direction of base planes for DNA sequencing", "keywords": ["DNA", "DNA sequencing", "Electronic transport", "Nucleoside"], "venue": "Nanoscale Research Letters", "year": 2012, "abstract": "Putting the four DNA nucleosides in the middle of gold [111] nanoelectrodes with base planes parallel to the electrode surface layer, we study the transverse electronic transport properties of four nucleosides along the direction of electrodes.

METHODS: This is a retrospective, non-randomized controlled study. We performed SOR with 23-gauge infusion and 20-gauge active suction technique on 29 patients 29 eyes from April to October, 2011 (mixed group). During the surgeries, a 23-gauge sclerotomy was made for infusion and a 20-gauge sclerotomy was used for active silicone oil suction. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (OCT) was applied for 23-gauge sclerotomy analysis 1 day post-operation. Traditional 20-gauge SOR was performed on another consecutive 29 patients 29 eyes, the control group (20G group). RESULTS: There were 2 eyes (6.9%) in mixed group and 5 eyes (17.2%) in 20G group which had recurrent retinal detachment after surgery. Hopytony (IOP \u2264 6mmHg) occurred in 8 eyes (27.6%) of mixed group and in 10 eyes (34.5%) of 20G group post-operation, but all of them recovered to the normal level finally. There were no statistical significant differences. Final visual acuity was significantly increased after surgery in both groups. Anterior segment OCT images were acquired from 13 eyes of mixed group, and all of them had a proper wound apposition. But local ciliary detachment was found in 9 eyes (69%). It was hard to define the OCT image of the sclerotomies and ciliary body because of the serious conjunctival hemorrhages and chemosis in 20G group. CONCLUSION: This mixed technique is a convenient and effective way to remove high viscosity silicone oil. Compared with traditional 20-gauge SOR, it does not increase the risk of post-operative complications and has less conjunctival reactions. Transient postoperative hypotony is common for this procedure and subclinical ciliochoroidal detachment is a probable cause.

MD simulations indicate that the R-BN molecules stand perpendicularly on the water surface due to hydrogen bonding with the water molecules.

The theoretical SFVS agrees well with the experimental result. The origin of the SFVS peaks and symmetry properties of the hyperpolarizabilities tensor are also analyzed, which indicates that theoretical computations can obtain the most important components that are helpful for experimental SFVS analysis.

A new equation of motion to calculate the dipole-dipole correlation functions within the MQCL formalism is first presented. Two approximate methods are then proposed to solve the resulted equations of motion. The first approximation results in a mean field approach, where the nuclear dynamics is governed by averaged forces depending on the instantaneous electronic states. A modification to the mean field approach based on first order moment expansion is also proposed.

Three different schemes are used to decompose the bath spectral density into analytical forms that are suitable to the HEOM treatment: (1) The multiple Lorentzian mode model that can be obtained by numerically fitting the model spectral density. (2) The combined Debye and oscillatory Debye modes model that can be constructed by fitting the corresponding classical bath correlation function. (3) A new method that uses undamped harmonic oscillator modes explicitly in the HEOM formalism. Methods to extract system-bath correlations were investigated for the above bath decomposition schemes. We also show that HEOM in the undamped harmonic oscillator modes can give detailed information on the partial Wigner transform of the total density operator. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations of the spin-Boson dynamics and the absorption line shape of molecular dimers show that the HEOM formalism for high order perturbations can serve as an important tool in studying the quantum dissipative dynamics in the intermediate coupling regime. \u00a9 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.", "pid": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151b7518"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Weiwei Xie", "org": "Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciences, Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1502fa9a"}, {"name": "Yang Xu", "org": "Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciences, Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e151339ea"}, {"name": "Lili Zhu", "org": "Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciences, Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1518be92"}, {"name": "Qiang Shi", "org": "Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciences, Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fd3e90"}], "title": "Mixed quantum classical calculation of proton transfer reaction rates: From deep tunneling to over the barrier regimes", "venue": "Journal of Chemical Physics", "year": 2014, "abstract": "We present mixed quantum classical calculations of the proton transfer (PT) reaction rates represented by a double well system coupled to a dissipative bath. The rate constants are calculated within the so called nontraditional view of the PT reaction, where the proton motion is quantized and the solvent polarization is used as the reaction coordinate. Quantization of the proton degree of freedom results in a problem of non-adiabatic dynamics. By employing the reactive flux formulation of the rate constant, the initial sampling starts from the transition state defined using the collective reaction coordinate. Dynamics of the collective reaction coordinate is treated classically as over damped diffusive motion, for which the equation of motion can be derived using the path integral, or the mixed quantum classical Liouville equation methods. The calculated mixed quantum classical rate constants agree well with the results from the numerically exact hierarchical equation of motion approach for a broad range of model parameters. Moreover, we are able to obtain contributions from each vibrational state to the total reaction rate, which helps to understand the reaction mechanism from the deep tunneling to over the barrier regimes. The numerical results are also compared with those from existing approximate theories based on calculations of the non-adiabatic transmission coefficients. It is found that the two-surface Landau-Zener formula works well in calculating the transmission coefficients in the deep tunneling regime, where the crossing point between the two lowest vibrational states dominates the total reaction rate. When multiple vibrational levels are involved, including additional crossing points on the free energy surfaces is important to obtain the correct reaction rate using the Landau-Zener formula. \u00a9 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.", "pid": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fb00a8"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Yingtao Xie", "org": "Department of Electronic Engineering, National Engineering Lab for TFT-LCD Key Materials and Technologies, Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f5f03e"}, {"name": "Shucheng Cai", "org": "Department of Electronic Engineering, National Engineering Lab for TFT-LCD Key Materials and Technologies, Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f4fc61"}, {"name": "Qiang Shi", "org": "Department of Electronic Engineering, National Engineering Lab for TFT-LCD Key Materials and Technologies, Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fd3e90"}, {"name": "Shihong Ouyang", "org": "Department of Electronic Engineering, National Engineering Lab for TFT-LCD Key Materials and Technologies, Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1505438f"}, {"name": "Wen-Ya Lee", "org": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f75e63"}, {"name": "Zhenan Bao", "org": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150dcdec"}, {"name": "James R.

An adaptive image denoising algorithm that integrates a constant time bilateral filter with noise-level estimation is proposed. The estimation of the noise-level function (NLF), which describes the noise level as a function of image brightness, is the key to ensure the removal of the color noise. To achieve this aim, a bilateral median filter is exploited to estimate the upper bound of NLF by fitting a lower envelope to the standard deviations of per-segment image variances. Furthermore, we make an empirical study on the relationship between the optimal parameter of constant time bilateral filter and the noise level. Then, an adaptive denoising algorithm, where the filtering parameter is automatically adjusted according to the estimated noise level, is conducted to obtain the underlying clean image from the noisy input.

Methodology: We generated stable cell lines overexpressing miR-18a in SGC-7901 cells. Cell proliferation was assessed by the MTT assay. The effects of miR-18a overexpression on tumor growth and angiogenesis were assessed. Because of the key role of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling in gastric cancer progression, we also tested whether miR-18a overexpression affected the mTOR pathway. Results: Ectopic expression of miR-18a significantly diminished cell proliferation in SGC-7901 cells (p<0.01). miR-18a overexpression significantly retarded SGC-7901 xenograft growth by 71.8% in vivo, and caused a marked reduction in tumor angiogenesis assessed by CD31-stained microvessel count. Western blot analysis of the xenografts showed that miR-18a overexpression substantially reduced the phosphorylation of two mTOR substrates, S6K1 and 4E-BP1, indicative of art inactivation of the mTOR pathway. Accompanying with the mTOR inactivation, the angiogenic factors, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor, were significantly downregulated. Conclusions: These data highlighted an important role for miR-18a in controlling gastric cancer growth and angiogenesis, therefore offering a possible therapeutic strategy against this malignancy. \u00a9 H.G.E.

METHODS: Quantitative RT-PCR analysis was used to examine the expression levels of miR-132 in five CRC cell lines (SW480, SW620, HCT116, HT29 and LoVo) and a normal colonic cell line NCM460, as well as in tumor tissues with or without metastases. The Kaplan- Meier method was used to analyze the prognostic significance of miR-132 in CRC patients. The biological effects of miR-132 were assessed in CRC cell lines using the transwell assay. Quantitative RT-PCR and western blot analyses were employed to evaluate the expression of miR-132 targets. The regulation of ZEB2 by miR-132 was confirmed using the luciferase activity assay. RESULTS: miR-132 was significantly down-regulated in the CRC cell lines compared with the normal colonic cell line (P < 0.05), as well as in the CRC tissues with distant metastases compared with the tissues without metastases (10.52 \u00b1 4.69 vs 23.11 \u00b1 7.84) (P < 0.001). Down-regulation of miR-132 was associated with tumor size (P = 0.016), distant metastasis (P = 0.002), and TNM stage (P = 0.020) in CRC patients. Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis indicated that patients with low expression of miR-132 tended to have worse diseasefree survival than patients with high expression of miR-132 (P < 0.001). Moreover, ectopic expression of miR-132 markedly inhibited cell invasion (P < 0.05) and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in CRC cell lines. Further investigation revealed ZEB2, an EMT regulator, was a downstream target of miR-132. CONCLUSION: Our study indicated that miR-132 plays an important role in the invasion and metastasis of CRC. \u00a9 2014 Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

When the liquid was added with lower flow-rates, particle circulation pattern was dominated by gas flow/liquid evaporation action, and thus particles display ascending at the center and descending near the wall (ACDW) with particle motion enhanced, meanwhile bubble sizes increased at the beginning and then decreased to steady values. With increasing liquid flow-rate or decreasing gas velocity, liquid bridge action relative to gas flow action intensity (LRGI) increased, and thus the particle circulation pattern gradually became dominated by the liquid bridge action.

Methods: A decision-analytic model designed for pneumococcal disease and outcomes of pneumococcal infection was populated with local, age-specific incidence and cost data to estimate the expected economic benefits from vaccinating a birth cohort of 172,183 infants in Shanghai over a 1-year period using a cross-sectional approach. The analysis was assumed to occur in a year at which time the direct and indirect effects of vaccination have reached a steady state. Costs were calculated from a payer perspective and included vaccination program costs and direct medical expenditures from pneumococcal-related disease. Results: The model predicts that 112,629 cases of pneumococcal-related disease could be prevented during a given year following the introduction of the PCV7 vaccine into the City Immunity Program in Shanghai, leading to a reduction of \u00a5187,923,359 (US $29,067,790) in direct medical costs. Overall, the inclusion of the PCV7 vaccine is estimated to have a cost-per-life-year saved of \u00a537,468 (US $5,796) and a cost-per-quality-adjusted-life-year gained of \u00a541,603 (US $6,435) when both the direct and indirect effects of the vaccine resulting from herd protection are taken into account. Conclusions: Results suggest that including PCV7 into the City Immunity Program in Shanghai could be considered cost-effective under generally accepted willingness-to-pay thresholds when both the direct and indirect effects of the vaccine are considered in the analysis. \u00a9 2014 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR).", "pid": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1517f7c1"}, {"authors": [{"name": "ShanLian Hu", "org": "Shanghai Health Development Research Center", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1505fe83"}, {"name": "Qiang Shi", "org": "Health Economics and Outcomes Research, Pfizer Investment Co.

The model incorporates both the direct impact on vaccinated children and the indirect effect of herd protection on unvaccinated children and adults. Results: The model predicts that more than 16.2 million cases of pneumococcal disease and 709 411 deaths could be prevented in China over the initial 10-year period following the introduction of the PCV7 vaccine. The majority of these health benefits are due to the indirect effectiveness of the vaccine on the unvaccinated population, resulting in approximately 10.8 million cases prevented and 636 371 lives saved over 10 years.

Consequently, improving prediction of DILI at an early stage of drug discovery will reduce the potential failures in the subsequent drug development program. In this regard, high-content screening (HCS) assays are considered as a promising strategy for the study of DILI; however, the predictive performance of HCS assays is frequently insufficient. In the present study, a new testing strategy was developed to improve DILI prediction by employing in vitro assays that was combined with the RO2 model (i.e., 'rule-of-two' defined by daily dose \u2265100 mg/day & logP \u22653). The RO2 model was derived from the observation that high daily doses and lipophilicity of an oral medication were associated with significant DILI risk in humans. In the developed testing strategy, the RO2 model was used for the rational selection of candidates for HCS assays, and only the negatives predicted by the RO2 model were further investigated by HCS. Subsequently, the effects of drug treatment on cell loss, nuclear size, DNA damage/fragmentation, apoptosis, lysosomal mass, mitochondrial membrane potential, and steatosis were studied in cultures of primary rat hepatocytes. Using a set of 70 drugs with clear evidence of clinically relevant DILI, the testing strategy improved the accuracies by 10 % and reduced the number of drugs requiring experimental assessment by approximately 20 %, as compared to the HCS assay alone. Moreover, the testing strategy was further validated by including published data (Cosgrove et al. in Toxicol Appl Pharmacol 237:317-330, 2009) on drug-cytokine-induced hepatotoxicity, which improved the accuracies by 7 %. Taken collectively, the proposed testing strategy can significantly improve the prediction of in vitro assays for detecting DILI liability in an early drug discovery phase. \u00a9 2014 Springer-Verlag.", "pid": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15feb4de"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Zuquan Weng", "org": "Division of Systems Biology", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fdd342"}, {"name": "Yong Luo", "org": "Division of Systems Biology", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f63700"}, {"name": "Xi Yang", "org": "Division of Systems Biology", "id": "5b5433e3e1cd8e4e15f46a75"}, {"name": "James J.

The basis of this toxicity is unknown; one possible mechanism, that of mitochondrial damage, was tested. In isolated rat liver mitochondria, regorafenib directly uncoupled oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and promoted calcium overload-induced swelling, which were respectively prevented by the recoupler 6-ketocholestanol (KC) and the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) pore blocker cyclosporine A (CsA). In primary hepatocytes, regorafenib uncoupled OXPHOS, disrupted mitochondrial inner membrane potential (MMP), and decreased cellular ATP at 1 h, and triggered MPT at 3. h, which was followed by necrosis but not apoptosis at 7 h and 24 h, all of which were abrogated by KC. The combination of the glycolysis enhancer fructose plus the mitochondrial ATPase synthase inhibitor oligomycin A abolished regorafenib induced necrosis at 7. h. This effect was not seen at 24. h nor with the fructose or oligomycin A separately. CsA in combination with trifluoperazine, both MPT blockers, showed similar effects. Two compensatory mechanisms, activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) to ameliorate ATP shortage and induction of autophagy to remove dysfunctional mitochondria, were found to be mobilized. Hepatocyte necrosis was enhanced either by the AMPK inhibitor Compound C or the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine, while autophagy inducer rapamycin was strongly cytoprotective. Remarkably, all toxic effects were observed at clinically-relevant concentrations of 2.5-15 \u03bcM.

This study aimed to provide a comprehensive review of drugs or diseases interacting with smoking, as presented in all US drug labelling. The 62,857 drug labels deposited in the FDA Online Label Repository were searched using the keywords \u2018smoke\u2019, \u2018smoker(s)\u2019, \u2018smoking\u2019, \u2018tobacco\u2019 and \u2018cigarette(s)\u2019 on 19 June 2014. The resultant records were refined to include only human prescription drug labelling, for manual examination. For 188 single-active-ingredient drugs and 36 multiple-active-ingredient drugs, the labelling was found to contain smoking-related information. The pharmacokinetics of 29 and 21 single-active-ingredient drugs were affected and unaffected, respectively, by smoking. For the remaining drugs, the provided information related to smoking affecting efficacy, safety or diseases but not pharmacokinetics. Depending on the nature of specific drugs, the perturbation in pharmacokinetic parameters in smokers ranged from 13 to 500\u00a0%, in comparison with non-smokers. Dosage modifications in smokers are necessary for four drugs and may be necessary for six drugs, but are unnecessary for seven drugs although the pharmacokinetic parameters of four of them are affected by smoking. Cigarette smoking is a risk factor for 16 types of diseases or adverse drug reactions.

Quantitative analysis of expressions of MMP-2 and EMMPRIN were assessed by measuring the mean gray scale of Rb tissue with LEICA IM50 Color Pathologic Analysis System. The differences of expressions of MMP-2 and EMMPRIN in each clinical and pathological stage were statistically analyzed, and the same step was also undertaken to study the relationship between Rb with MMP-2 positive expression and that with EMMPRIN positive expression. RESULTS: The positive expression rate of MMP-2 was 90% (Gray value: 109.64\u00b114.52; 35/39), and that of EMMPRIN was 85% (Gray value: 108.01\u00b113.60; 33/39).

The increase of the Zn content from 3% to 8% in the alloys results in the increase of the eutectic MgZn phase.

Previously we demonstrated that usnic acid induces apoptosis and cytotoxicity in hepatic HepG2 cells. We also demonstrated that usnic acid induces autophagy as a survival mechanism against its cytotoxicity. In this study, we investigated and characterized further molecular mechanisms underlying the toxicity of usnic acid in HepG2 cells. We found that usnic acid causes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress demonstrated by the increased expression of typical ER stress markers, including CHOP, ATF-4, p-eIF2\u03b1, and spliced XBP1. Usnic acid inhibited the secretion of Gaussia luciferase measured by an ER stress reporter assay. An ER stress inhibitor 4-phenylbutyrate attenuated usnic acid-induced apoptosis. Moreover, usnic acid significantly increased the cytosolic free Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration. Usnic acid increased the expression of calcium release-activated calcium channel protein 1 (CRAM1 or ORAI1) and stromal interaction molecule 1, two key components of store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), which is the major Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx pathway in non-excitable cells, this finding was also confirmed in primary rat hepatocytes. Furthermore, knockdown of ORAI1 prevented ER stress and ATP depletion in response to usnic acid. In contrast, overexpression of ORAI1 increased ER stress and ATP depletion caused by usnic acid. Taken together, our results suggest that usnic acid disturbs calcium homeostasis, induces ER stress, and that usnic acid-induced cellular damage occurs at least partially via activation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel of SOCE.", "pid": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151b6f23"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Qiang Shi", "org": "Key Laboratory of Modern Agricultural Equipment and Technology of Ministry of Education, Jiangsu University", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1512b407"}], "title": "Numerical simulation for downwash flow field of small-size unmanned helicopter hedgehopping", "keywords": ["Downwash flow field", "Numerical simulations", "Plant protection", "Rotor", "Small-size unmanned helicopter"], "venue": "Paiguan Jixie Gongcheng Xuebao/Journal of Drainage and Irrigation Machinery Engineering", "year": 2015, "abstract": "In order to explore the downwash flow field characteristic of small-size unmanned helicopter hedgehopping, numerical simulations were conducted.

For many cases of ANSD, the underlying molecular pathology and the site of lesion remain unclear. The X-linked form of the condition, AUNX1, has been mapped to Xq23-q27.3, although the causative gene has yet to be identified. Methods: We performed whole-exome sequencing on DNA samples from the AUNX1 family and another small phenotypically similar but unrelated ANSD family. Results: We identified two missense mutations in AIFM1 in these families: c.1352G>A (p.R451Q) in the AUNX1 family and c.1030C>T ( p.L344F) in the second ANSD family. Mutation screening in a large cohort of 3 additional unrelated families and 93 sporadic cases with ANSD identified 9 more missense mutations in AIFM1.

The molecular mechanisms underlying CRC development involve a multistep process with the accumulation of both genetic and epigenetic changes. To deeply understand CRC tumorigenesis and progression, advances in identification of novel mechanisms and key factors are therefore in an urgent need. Here, we examined the correlation of factor inhibiting HIF-1\u03b1 (FIH-1) expression with clinicopathological features of CRC. The finding that FIH-1 was not only signi ficantly decreased in tumor tissue but also was significantly correlated with tumor invading depth, lymph node involvement, and metastasis suggested the role of FIH-1 as a tumor suppressor in CRC development. To further support the above hypothesis, we performed both in vitro and in vivo experiments to identify the role of FIH-1 in CRC development. FIH-1 was found to inhibit CRC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and colony formation in vitro. FIH-1 was also shown to repress LOVO xenograft tumor growth in vivo. To decipher the mechanism, we examined the expression level of HIF-1\u03b1 and its target genes. We found that FIH-1 was able to inhibit HIF1\u03b1 mediated transcription of GLUT1 and VEGF in CRC cells. The above observation points to the possibility that loss or decreased expression of FIH-1 gene may lead to a constitutive activation of HIF1\u03b1 and an alteration of HIF-1 targets such as GLUT-1 and VEGF. These findings highlight the critical role of FIH-1 in CRC and indicate FIH-1 functions as a tumor suppressor in human CRC by repressing HIF1\u03b1 pathway.", "pid": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1514a3d6"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Xuquan Li", "org": "Endoscopy Center, Endoscopy Research Institute, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f5a5c9"}, {"name": "Tao Chen", "org": "Endoscopy Center, Endoscopy Research Institute, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f60843"}, {"name": "Qiang Shi", "org": "Endoscopy Center, Endoscopy Research Institute, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e15053e7e"}, {"name": "Jian Li", "org": "Endoscopy Center, Endoscopy Research Institute, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1515dc6a"}, {"name": "Shilun Cai", "org": "Endoscopy Center, Endoscopy Research Institute, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1503a53b"}, {"name": "Pinghong Zhou", "org": "Endoscopy Center, Endoscopy Research Institute, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150bfebd"}, {"name": "Yunshi Zhong", "org": "Endoscopy Center, Endoscopy Research Institute, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1514ebdf"}, {"name": "Liqing Yao", "org": "Endoscopy Center, Endoscopy Research Institute, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f67342"}], "title": "Angiopoietin-like 4 enhances metastasis and inhibits apoptosis via inducing bone morphogenetic protein 7 in colorectal cancer cells", "keywords": ["ANGPTL4", "Apoptosis", "BMP7", "Colorectal cancer", "Metastasis"], "venue": "Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications", "year": 2015, "abstract": "Angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4), a secretory glycoprotein, plays an important role in cancer metastasis.

Moreover, liver metastasis was significantly associated with higher expression of ANGPTL4. In vitro studies further showed that overexpression of ANGPTL4 enhanced cell migration, invasion and inhibited apoptosis. At the molecular level, ANGPTL4 overexpression resulted in an up-regulation of bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP7).

Inorganic III-V semiconductor (GaAs) NIR lasers have achieved great successes but require expensive and sophisticated device fabrication techniques. Organic semiconductors exhibit chemically tunable optoelectronic properties together with self-assembling features that are well suitable for low-temperature solution processing. Major blocks in realizing NIR organic lasing include low stimulated emission of narrow-bandgap molecules due to fast nonradiative decay and exciton-exciton annihilation, which is considered as a main loss channel of population inversion for organic lasers under high carrier densities. Here we designed and synthesized the small organic molecule (E)-3-(4-(di-p-tolylamino)phenyl)-1-(1-hydroxynaphthalen-2-yl)prop-2-en-1-one (DPHP) with amphiphilic nature, which elaborately self-assembles into micrometer-sized hemispheres that simultaneously serves as the NIR emission medium with a photoluminescence quantum efficiency of \u223c15.2%, and the high-Q (\u223c1.4 \u00d7 10<sup>3</sup>) whispering gallery mode microcavity. Moreover, the radiative rate of DPHP hemispheres is enhanced up to \u223c1.98 \u00d7 10<sup>9</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> on account of the exciton-vibrational coupling in the solid state with the J-type molecular-coupling component, and meanwhile the exciton-exciton annihilation process is eliminated. As a result, NIR lasing with a low threshold of \u223c610 nJ/cm<sup>2</sup> is achieved in the single DPHP hemisphere at room temperature. Our demonstration is a major step toward incorporating the organic coherent light sources into the compact optoelectronic devices at NIR wavelengths.

In this contribution, the self-assembly behavior, molecular stacking structure, CT interactions, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and corresponding physicochemical properties of two similar halogen-bonded co-crystals are comprehensively investigated and compared, to construct an \"assembly-structure-CT-property\" relationship. Bpe-IFB wire-like crystals (where Bpe = 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethylene and IFB = 1,3,5-trifluoro-2,4,6-triiodobenzene), packed in a segregated stacking form with CT ground and excited states, are measured to be quasi-one-dimensional (1D) semiconductors and show strong violet-blue photoluminescence (PL) from the lowest CT<inf>1</inf> excitons (\u03a6<inf>PL</inf> = 26.1%), which can be confined and propagate oppositely along the 1D axial direction. In comparison, Bpe-F<inf>4</inf>DIB block-like crystals (F<inf>4</inf>DIB = 1,4-diiodotetrafluorobenzene), packed in a mixed stacking form without CT interactions, are determined to be insulators and exhibit unique white light emission and two-dimensional optical waveguide property. Surprisingly, it seems that the intrinsic spectroscopic states of Bpe and F<inf>4</inf>DIB do not change after co-crystallization, which is also confirmed by theoretical calculations, thus offering a new design principle for white light emitting materials. More importantly, we show that the CT interactions in co-crystals are related to their molecular packing and can be triggered or suppressed by crystal engineering, which eventually leads to distinct optoelectronic properties. These results help us to rationally control the CT interactions in organic D-A systems by tuning the molecular stacking, toward the development of a fantastic \"optoelectronic world\".
