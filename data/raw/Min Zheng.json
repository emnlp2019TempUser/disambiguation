We report the clinical and microbiological features of patients infected with influenza A H7N9 virus and compare genomic features of the human virus with those of the virus in market poultry in Zhejiang, China. Methods Between March 7 and April 8, 2013, we included hospital inpatients if they had new-onset respiratory symptoms, unexplained radiographic infiltrate, and laboratory-confirmed H7N9 virus infection. We recorded histories and results of haematological, biochemical, radiological, and microbiological investigations. We took throat and sputum samples, used RT-PCR to detect M, H7, and N9 genes, and cultured samples in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. We tested for co-infections and monitored serum concentrations of six cytokines and chemokines.We collected cloacal swabs from 86 birds from epidemiologically linked wet markets and inoculated embryonated chicken eggs with the samples. We identified and subtyped isolates by RT-PCR sequencing. RNA extraction, complementary DNA synthesis, and PCR sequencing were done for one human and one chicken isolate. We characterised and phylogenetically analysed the eight gene segments of the viruses in the patient's and the chicken's isolates, and constructed phylogenetic trees of H, N, PB2, and NS genes. Findings We identified four patients (mean age 56 years), all of whom had contact with poultry 3-8 days before disease onset. They presented with fever and rapidly progressive pneumonia that did not respond to antibiotics. Patients were leucopenic and lymphopenic, and had impaired liver or renal function, substantially increased serum cytokine or chemokine concentrations, and disseminated intravascular coagulation with disease progression. Two patients died. Sputum specimens were more likely to test positive for the H7N9 virus than were samples from throat swabs. The viral isolate from the patient was closely similar to that from an epidemiologically linked market chicken. All viral gene segments were of avian origin. The H7 of the isolated viruses was closest to that of the H7N3 virus from domestic ducks in Zhejiang, whereas the N9 was closest to that of the wild bird H7N9 virus in South Korea. We noted Gln226Leu and Gly186Val substitutions in human virus H7 (associated with increased affinity for \u03b1-2,6-linked sialic acid receptors) and the PB2 Asp701Asn mutation (associated with mammalian adaptation). Ser31Asn mutation, which is associated with adamantane resistance, was noted in viral M2. Interpretation Cross species poultry-to-person transmission of this new reassortant H7N9 virus is associated with severe pneumonia and multiorgan dysfunction in human beings. Monitoring of the viral evolution and further study of disease pathogenesis will improve disease management, epidemic control, and pandemic preparedness.", "pid": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f8ab63"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Dazhi Jin", "org": "Department of Laboratory Medicine", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15002978"}, {"name": "Yun Luo", "org": "Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1502a7f9"}, {"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Disease", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f85860"}, {"name": "Haijing Li", "org": "Department of Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150ad81a"}, {"name": "Jing Zhang", "org": "ACEA Biosciences", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1517205d"}, {"name": "Melinda Stampfl", "org": "ACEA Biosciences", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151e583e"}, {"name": "Xiao Xu", "org": "ACEA Biosciences", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151bf5f0"}, {"name": "Gangqiang Ding", "org": "Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fadb5b"}, {"name": "Yanjun Zhang", "org": "Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1505b28f"}, {"name": "Yi-Wei Tang", "org": "Department of Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fbb4e9"}], "title": "Quantitative detection of vibrio cholera toxin by real-time and dynamic cytotoxicity monitoring", "venue": "Journal of Clinical Microbiology", "year": 2013, "abstract": "We report here the quantitative detection of Vibrio cholerae toxin (CT) in isolates and stool specimens by dynamic monitoring of the full course of CT-mediated cytotoxicity in a real-time cell analysis (RTCA) system. Four cell lines, including Y-1 mouse adrenal tumor cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, small intestine epithelial (FHs74Int) cells, and mouse adrenal gland (PC12-Adh) cells, were evaluated for their suitability for CT-induced cytotoxicity testing. Among them, the Y-1 line was demonstrated to be the most sensitive for CT-mediated cytotoxicity, with limits of detection of 7.0 pg/ml for purified CT and 0.11 ng/ml for spiked CT in pooled negative stool specimens. No CT-mediated cytotoxicity was observed for nontoxigenic V. cholerae, non-V. cholerae species, or non-V. cholerae enterotoxins. The CT-RTCA assay was further validated with 100 stool specimens consecutively collected from patients with diarrhea and 200 V. cholerae isolates recovered from patients and the environment, in comparison to a reference using three detection methods. The CT-RTCA assay had sensitivities and specificities of 97.5% and 100.0%, respectively, for V. cholerae isolates and 90.0% and 97.2% for stool specimens. For stool specimens spiked with CT concentrations ranging from 3.5 pg/ml to 1.8 ng/ml, the inoculation-to-detection time was 1.120.38 h, and the values were inversely correlated with CT concentrations (1; P0.01). The results indicate that the CT-RTCA assay with the Y-1 cell line provides a rapid and sensitive tool for the quantitative detection of CT activities in clinical specimens. \u00a9 2013, American Society for Microbiology.

At the optimal irradiation time of 2.0. h, the obtained nitrite accumulation ratio and SND efficiency at full aerobic were 73.9% and 72.8%, respectively. Nitrite accumulation was the result of increased NH4+-N removal and improved ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) activity with simultaneous inhibition of nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) activity. Ultrasonic treatment could provide suitable conditions in temperature and pH for AOB growth, and destroy the NOB community structure.

Recent reports have associated alcohol exposure with histone H3 acetylation. In the present study, we have performed the experiments to test the hypothesis that histone H3K14 acetylation is the key role in the fetal heart leads to over-expression of cardiac specific genes DHAND and EHAND caused by prenatal alcohol exposure. Seventy pregnant C57BL/6 mice were divided randomly into seven groups (n= 10). They were the untreated group, dimethyl sulfoxide group, alcohol exposure group, curcumin treatment group, both alcohol and curcumin treatment group, SAHA treatment group, both alcohol and SAHA treatment group. Fetal mouse hearts were collected on embryonic day 14.5. The changes of HATs activities, the acetylation levels of histone H3K14 (H3K14ac), the expression levels of cardiac specific genes DHAND and EHAND, and structure of chromatin were determined. Our data indicates that curcumin and SAHA significantly reduces and increases the activities of HATs and the levels of histone H3K14ac in fetal hearts, respectively. The expression of DHAND and EHAND is significantly down-regulated and up-regulated in the groups treated with curcumin and SAHA. Furthermore, our results from ChIP assays have shown that the histone H3K14ac connects with the DHAND and EHAND genes are significantly inhibited by curcumin and simulated by SAHA. Our study suggests that prenatal alcohol exposure causes the over-expression of DHAND and EHAND by increasing H3K14ac in mice. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.", "pid": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150e3e18"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Linzhao Zhang", "org": "Key Laboratory for Physical Electronics and Devices of the Ministry of Education and Shaanxi Key, Laboratory of Information Photonic Technique, School of Electronics and Information Engineering", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e15183ad9"}, {"name": "Wen Ding", "org": "Solid State Lighting Engineering Research Center, School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1515fb84"}, {"name": "Feng Yun", "org": "Solid State Lighting Engineering Research Center, School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e150843f2"}, {"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "Solid State Lighting Engineering Research Center, School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1507ab75"}, {"name": "Deyang Xia", "org": "Solid State Lighting Engineering Research Center, School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e151716e5"}, {"name": "Qiang Li", "org": "Solid State Lighting Engineering Research Center, School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fa1347"}, {"name": "Maofeng Guo", "org": "Solid State Lighting Engineering Research Center, School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150e8cd2"}, {"name": "Ye Zhang", "org": "Solid State Lighting Engineering Research Center, School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150f1500"}, {"name": "Shuo Liu", "org": "Shaanxi New Light Source Co, LTD", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e15183f17"}, {"name": "Xun Hou", "org": "Solid State Lighting Engineering Research Center, School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150afa1f"}], "title": "Study of optical stability for vertical high-power white light-emitting diodes", "venue": "Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering", "year": 2015, "abstract": "With the development of lighting technology, high-power white LEDs will become the future mainstream technology. At present, there are still many problems in optical stability, reliability, heat dissipation. This paper focuses on the optical properties of vertical high-power white LEDs. The measurement results of the luminous flux output, correlated color temperature and color coordinates of the white and blue LEDs after 1100 hours of aging life testing under the drive current of 350 mA show us that the color coordinates of the white LED changed from (0.3362,0.3700) to (0.3359,0.3698) and shifts to the blue color coordinates direction. The luminous flux output of the white LED is declined from 95.002lm to 93.046lm. The color temperature declines from 5403k to 5383k. After the rapid temperature changes, the aging speed of white LED is faster than the blue LED\u2122s.

The aim of the study is to identify distinct groups according to the etiologies of precipitating events. A total of 405 ACLF patients were identified from 1,361 patients with cirrhosis with acute decompensation and categorized according to the types of acute insults. Clinical characteristics and prognosis between the hepatic group and extrahepatic group were compared, and the performance of prognostic models was tested in different groups. Two distinct groups (hepatic-ACLF and extrahepatic-ACLF) were identified among the ACLF population. Hepatic-ACLF was precipitated by hepatic insults and had relatively well-compensated cirrhosis with frequent liver and coagulation failure. In contrast, extrahepatic-ACLF was exclusively precipitated by extrahepatic insults, characterized by more severe underlying cirrhosis and high occurrence of extrahepatic organ failures (kidney, cerebral, circulation, and respiratory systems). Both groups had comparably high short-term mortality (28-day transplant-free mortality: 48.3% vs. 50.7%; P=0.22); however, the extra-hepatic-ACLF group had significantly higher 90-day and 1-year mortality (90-day: 58.9% vs. 68.3%, P=0.035; 1-year: 63.9% vs. 74.6%, P=0.019). In hepatic-ACLF group, the integrated Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (iMELD) score had the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (auROC=0.787) among various prognostic models in predicting 28-day mortality, whereas CLIF-Consortium scores for ACLF patients (CLIF-C-ACLF) had the highest predictive value in the other group (auROC=0.779). Conclusions: ACLF precipitated by hepatic insults is distinct from ACLF precipitated by extrahepatic insults in clinical presentation and prognosis. The iMELD score may be a better predictor for hepatic-ACLF short-term prognosis, whereas CLIF-C-ACLF may be better for extrahepatic-ACLF patients.", "pid": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f765d3"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Shi-Ming Zhou", "org": "T.-D.

Functional abnormalities of monocytes have been observed in both diseases. We sought to determine whether these abnormalities are reflected by an altered phenotypic expression of functionally active surface molecules. Peripheral blood monocyte subsets varying in cellular density and cell size from patients with psoriasis and atopic dermatitis were investigated using FACS analysis employing a panel of monoclonal antibodies (CD14, CD16, HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, Fc\u03b5RII, IL-2R, ICAM-1, CR3). Furthermore, the modulation of expression by interferon-\u03b3 in monocyte subsets from patients was compared to normal controls. The results show that HLA-DR and -DQ expression on monocyte subsets in psoriatic patients was significantly decreased; 'large' monocytes expressed significantly less HLA-DR than 'small' monocyte subpopulations. Decreased HLA-DR and -DQ expression could be upregulated by incubation of psoriatic monocytes with IFN\u03b3. In atopic dermatitis, a different phenotype pattern of monocyte subsets was demonstrated: HLA-DR expression and HLA-DQ expression were both decreased in both 'large' and 'small' monocytes as compared to normal controls. However, there were no significant differences in HLA-DR and HLA-DQ expression between 'large' and 'small' monocyte subpopulations in atopic dermatitis. Moreover, the ICAM-1 and IL-2R expression of 'large' and 'small' monocyte subpopulations was significantly decreased in atopic patients from levels in normal controls and psoriatic patients. The altered expression of HLA-DR, - DQ, ICAM-1 and IL-2R could be upregulated by incubation of atopic monocytes with IFN\u03b3. In addition, there was a significant increase in the percentage of monocytes in the differential count of patients with psoriasis or atopic dermatitis. We conclude that the differential phenotype pattern of surface molecules on monocytes in psoriasis and atopic dermatitis may reflect an abnormal monocyte maturation/differentiation state.

The differences of the expressions were significant between the patients from each groups (alcoholic steatosis, alcoholic hepatitis and alcoholic cirrhosis) and the controls (1.168 \u00b1 0.852, 1.462 \u00b1 1.657, 1.329 \u00b1 0.610 vs 0.808 \u00b1 0.276, P < 0.050). No significant differences of TGF -beta 1 mRNA expression were observed between alcohol abusers without liver impairment and controls. The expressions in patients with alcoholic hepatitis and alcoholic cirrhosis were significantly greater than that in alcohol abusers respectively (1.462 \u00b1 1.657, 1.329 \u00b1 0.610 vs 0.841 \u00b1 0.706, P < 0.050).

Methods: 114 serum samples from chronic hepatitis patients were assayed for fibrosis indices including HA, PCIII, PIIINP, LN and IV-C with radioimmunoassay (RIA). Liver biopsy was also performed in all these patients and the biopsy material was examined histopathologically.

Methods. 2600 serum samples from chronic hepatitis patients were assayed for fibrosis indexes including HA, PCIII, LN and IV-C with RIA. Liver biopsy was performed in 280 of those patients and the biopsy material was examined histopathologically. The inflammation grade of the liver, stage of fibrosis and degree of chronic hepatitis were recorded and were compared with fibrotic indexes. Results. Among 2600 chronic hepatitis patients, every fibrotic index had a significant correlation with the inflammation grade, fibrosis staging and the degree of chronic hepatitis (P < 0.01).

The wireless response is transient and can only be detectable in a proximity after switching off the interrogation. Due to the fact that, while used as a sensor, the resonant frequency of the resonator is related to and varying with the measurand, the interrogation to a passive SAW resonator sensor has to trace and follow the correspondent variation of the frequency band of the device. The energy evaluation of the response is applied to detect the availability of the sensing response and is used as a feedback argument to roughly localize the operational frequency range of the sensor. A modified frequency estimation is employed to estimate the sensing characteristic frequency in the transient wireless sensing signal with a low signal-to-noise ratio.

In addition, 28 healthy subjects were included as controls. Blood sera of these 88 people were examined with regard to the levels of YKL-40 and HA. The former was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and serum HA was determined by a commercially available radioimmunoassay method. On the basis of the ultrasonographic investigations, HA levels in normal, mild, and severe cases of hepatic fibrosis were 83.0 \u00b1 35.7, 216.1 \u00b1 77.9 and 212.6 \u00b1 80.9 \u03bcg/ml, respectively.

Nevertheless, the role of DPC derived chemokines and other cytokines in the hair follicle biology remain speculative. In this study, we investigated the expression of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), endothelin-1 (ET-1) and stem cell factor (SCF) in different passages of cultured DPC and their effects on the biological behaviour of DPC. Methods: The expression of bFGF, ET-1 and SCF in different passages of cultured DPC and their possible effects on the biological behavior of DPC are investigated using in situ hybridization and immunochemistry. In addition, we performed transplantation of hair follicle cells into nude mice. The cultured DPC, dermal sheath cells and fibroblast of human scalp, respectively, were mixed with cells of the hair follicle epithelium in different ratios, and then were cultured in hair follicle organotypic cultures or implanted into the subcutis of nude mice. Results: The expression of ET-1 and SCF in early passages of cultured DPC became stronger, but turned weaker and even negative in late passages (>6 passages). Hair follicle-like structures were formed after DPC combined with the cells of hair follicle epithelium cells in hair follicle organotypic cultures. When hair follicle organotypic cultures were implanted into the subcutis of nude mice, the relative intact hair follicles were formed. After the transplantation of hair follicle cells into the nude mice, the hair follicle-like structure was formed in the group that contained DPC mixed with hair follicle epithelium cells. However, no hair follicles were formed in the other two groups. It was found that the higher the expression of ET-1 and SCF in DPC, the stronger the ability of DPC to induce hair follicle regeneration. Conclusions: The cultured DPC can induce hair follicle regeneration and sustain hair growth in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, the expression of ET-1 and SCF is correlated with the ability of DPC inducing hair follicle regeneration.", "pid": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e150818b6"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Shuyang Yu", "org": "State Key Laboratory for Agrobiotechnology", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1502960d"}, {"name": "Mifang Liang", "org": "State Key Laboratory for Infectious Diseases Control and Prevention", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e15133f64"}, {"name": "BaoLiang Fan", "org": "Animal Science and Technology College", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150ce077"}, {"name": "Hongtao Xu", "org": "State Key Laboratory for Agrobiotechnology", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150a2674"}, {"name": "Chuan Li", "org": "State Key Laboratory for Infectious Diseases Control and Prevention", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150c5812"}, {"name": "Quanfu Zhang", "org": "State Key Laboratory for Infectious Diseases Control and Prevention", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151e5073"}, {"name": "Dexin Li", "org": "State Key Laboratory for Infectious Diseases Control and Prevention", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151d8ea6"}, {"name": "Bo Tang", "org": "State Key Laboratory for Agrobiotechnology", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1508256c"}, {"name": "Shijie Li", "org": "State Key Laboratory for Agrobiotechnology", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15120d54"}, {"name": "Yunping Dai", "org": "State Key Laboratory for Agrobiotechnology", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15113973"}, {"name": "Meili Wang", "org": "State Key Laboratory for Agrobiotechnology", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f4beee"}, {"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "State Key Laboratory for Agrobiotechnology", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f85860"}, {"name": "Bingxue Yan", "org": "State Key Laboratory for Agrobiotechnology", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e151845d2"}, {"name": "Qinghong Zhu", "org": "State Key Laboratory for Agrobiotechnology", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1517e22d"}, {"name": "Ning Li", "org": "State Key Lab. for Agrobiotechnology", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e15073363"}], "title": "Maternally derived recombinant human anti-hantavirus monoclonal antibodies are transferred to mouse offspring during lactation and neutralize virus in vitro", "venue": "Journal of Virology", "year": 2006, "abstract": "Transgenic mice expressing a recombinant human monoclonal antibody (rHMAb) against hantavirus were generated.

Consequently, an important goal is the development of a vaccine that can provide rapid protection while overcoming the potential risk associated with the production of conventional inactivated vaccines. An important secondary feature of the vaccine would be the ability to distinguish vaccinated from infected animals. A recombinant fowlpox virus (vUTAL3CP1) containing FMDV capsid polypeptide and 3C coding regions of O/NY00 was constructed and evaluated for its ability to induce humoral and cellular responses in mice and guinea pigs. In addition, the ability to protect guinea pigs against homologous virus challenge was examined. Mice and guinea pigs were given booster vaccinations twice and once, respectively, and guinea pigs were challenged 20 days after the booster vaccination. Control groups included animals inoculated with commercial vaccine, fowlpox virus or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). All animals vaccinated with vUTAL3CP1 developed specific anti-FMDV antibody and neutralizing antibody, as well as T lymphocyte proliferation response and CTL cytotoxic activity. Three of four guinea pigs vaccinated with vUTAL3CP1 were completely protected from viral challenge.

Methods: The experimen t was carried out in the Research Center of Stem Cells, Academy of Military Medical Sciences between February 2004 and June 2005. (1) Sixty Wistar rats were randomly divided into traditional group (n=20), improved group (n=30) and control group (n=10). (2) The rats were administered with stereotaxic microinjection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into the right substantia nigra compact part and the midbrain ventral tegmental area in the traditional group, and only the midbrain ventral tegmental area in the improved group, and those in the control group were injected with 4 \u03bcL, saline containing ascorbic acid (2 g/L) into the right substantia nigra compact part and the midbrain ventral tegmental area. (3) The changes of behaviors and the quantity of midbrain nigra dopaminergic neurons were detected. Results: One and 4 rats died within 1 week postoperatively in the control group and traditional group respectively, and there was no death in the improved group. Behavioral test and immunohistochemical detection showed that (1) In the improved group (n=30), 22 rats rotated stably, with an average > 7 rounds per minute, and the successful ratio exceeded 70%, which was equivalent to that in the traditional group. The mortality in the improved group was lower than that in the traditional group (20%) and control group (10%). (2) Postoperatively, part of the rats in the traditional group and improved group had the abnormal behaviors of tremor, retardation, irritability, piloerection and stiffness of tail, etc. (3) The number of dopaminergic neurons in midbrain nigra of the injected side was obviously reduced by more than 90% in the successful rat models of Parkinson disease, and there was no significant difference between the improved group and traditional group (P > 0.05), which were significantly decreased as compared with that in the control group (P < 0.001).

VEGF receptors (VEGFRs, including VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3) and neuropilins (NRPs, including NRP-1 and NRP-2) are high-affinity receptors for VEGF and are typically considered to be specific for endothelial cells. Here we showed expression of VEGFRs and NRPs on cultured epidermal keratinocytes at both mRNA and protein levels. We further localized these receptors by immunofluorescence (IF) staining in the epidermis of surgical skin specimens. We found positive staining for VEGFRs and NRPs in all layers of the epidermis except for the stratum corneum. VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 are primarily expressed on the cytoplasmic membrane of basal cells and the adjacent spinosum keratinocytes. All layers of the epidermis except for the horny cell layer demonstrated a uniform pattern of VEGFR-3, NRP-1, and NRP-2. Sections staining for NRP-1 and NRP-2 also showed diffuse intense fluorescence and were localized to the cell membrane and cytoplasm of keratinocytes. In another panel of experiments, keratinocytes were treated with different concentrations of VEGF, with or without VEGFR-2 neutralizing antibody in culture. VEGF enhanced the proliferation and migration of keratinocytes, and these effects were partially inhibited by pretreatment with VEGFR-2 neutralizing antibody. Adhesion of keratinocytes to type IV collagen-coated culture plates was decreased by VEGF treatment, but this reduction could be completely reversed by pretreatment with VEGFR-2 neutralizing antibody. Taken together, our results suggest that the expression of VEGFRs and NRPs on keratinocytes may constitute important regulators for its activity and may possibly be responsible for the autocrine signaling in the epidermis.", "pid": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f96f64"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Di-Long Chen", "org": "Key Laboratory of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology", "id": "5b5433e3e1cd8e4e15f40f39"}, {"name": "Jing Li", "org": "Key Laboratory of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150b8744"}, {"name": "Yong-Gang Liu", "org": "Key Laboratory of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e152104c1"}, {"name": "Ya-Ping Wang", "org": "Key Laboratory of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e1510adca"}, {"name": "Ting-Mei Chen", "org": "Key Laboratory of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150f137c"}, {"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "Key Laboratory of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f85860"}, {"name": "Rong Jiang", "org": "Key Laboratory of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15035b1e"}], "title": "Effect of ginseng polysaccharide on expression of GM-CSF, EPO, and their receptors in K562 cells", "keywords": ["Ginseng polysaccharide (GPS)", "Hematopoietic growth factor", "K562"], "venue": "Chinese Traditional and Herbal Drugs", "year": 2006, "abstract": "Objective: To study the effect of ginseng polysaccharide (GPS) on the expression of GM-CSF, EPO, and their receptors in K562 cells.

Recently, vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs, including VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3) were found to be expressed in normal human epidermis and associated with proliferation and migration of keratinocytes. The purpose of this study is to investigate the expression of VEGFRs on psoriatic keratinocytes and the roles of calcium and VEGF in regulating VEGFR expression. Skin samples from 17 patients with chronic plaque psoriasis and 11 normal controls were included. The expression of VEGFRs in psoriatic keratinocytes at mRNA and protein levels was determined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis. Localization of the VEGFRs in skin lesions was determined by immuno-fluorescent method. Since keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation rely on calcium concentrations, and VEGF is overexpressed in psoriatic epidermis, we further investigated the roles of calcium and VEGF in regulating the expression of VEGFRs. Overexpression of VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 in psoriatic epidermis was demonstrated both at mRNA and protein levels in vitro. VEGFRs were strongly labeled in non-lesional, perilesional and lesional psoriatic keratinocytes in all viable epidermal stratums in vivo. Furthermore, both exogenous VEGF165 and calcium enhanced the expression of VEGFRs. Calcium also enhanced the expression of VEGF in non-lesional psoriatic keratinocytes, while targeted blockade of VEGF activity by bevacizum-ab could not inhibit calcium-induced up-regulation of protein levels of VEGFRs. We conclude from these results that VEGFRs are overexpressed in lesional psoriatic epidermal keratinocytes. Both calcium and VEGF regulate VEGFRs expression in psoriatic epidermis. More importantly, calcium is a potential regulator for VEGFR independent of VEGF. \u00a9 2008 Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine/Blackwell Publishing Ltd.", "pid": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e151204e4"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "Guangxi Center for Animal Disease Control and Prevention", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f85860"}, {"name": "Ning-Yi Jin", "org": "Military Veterinary Institute", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1506813b"}, {"name": "Chang Li", "org": "Military Veterinary Institute", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151adf89"}, {"name": "Hui-Jun Lu", "org": "Military Veterinary Institute", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1502e68e"}, {"name": "Ming-Xiao Ma", "org": "College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f7c1c7"}, {"name": "Guo-Shun Shen", "org": "College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150c6099"}, {"name": "Xiao-Wei Huo", "org": "College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150ae290"}, {"name": "Hai-Li Ma", "org": "College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15012f0f"}, {"name": "Xiao-Yue Chen", "org": "College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e15081d54"}, {"name": "Yong-Gang Qu", "org": "College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1513fda2"}], "title": "Expression and identification of FMDV 3ABC truncated gene in Pichia pastoris", "keywords": ["3ABC Truncated gene", "Diagnostic antigen", "Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV)", "Pichia pastoris", "Secretory expression"], "venue": "Gaodeng Xuexiao Huaxue Xuebao/Chemical Journal of Chinese Universities", "year": 2008, "abstract": "Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is an important pathogen worldwide; consequently, an important goal is the developments of diagnostic methods.

Our study suggests that scaled-up production in transgenic farm animals would yield sufficient human catalase for biomedical research and clinical therapies. \u00a9 2008.", "pid": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e15063544"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Ming-xiao Ma", "org": "College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f7c1c7"}, {"name": "Ning-yi Jin", "org": "Genetic Engineering Laboratory", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1506813b"}, {"name": "Hui-juan Liu", "org": "Genetic Engineering Laboratory", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150b5523"}, {"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "Genetic Engineering Laboratory", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f85860"}, {"name": "Ge-fen Yin", "org": "College of'Anima1 Science and IGterinary Medicine", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150f6178"}, {"name": "Ming-yao Tian", "org": "Genetic Engineering Laboratory", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151b5e1a"}, {"name": "Ming-Ian Jin", "org": "Genetic Engineering Laboratory", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151a4510"}, {"name": "Hui-jun Lu", "org": "Genetic Engineering Laboratory", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1502e68e"}, {"name": "Guo-shun Shen", "org": "Genetic Engineering Laboratory", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150c6099"}, {"name": "Guang-ze Zhu", "org": "Genetic Engineering Laboratory", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e15068ecd"}, {"name": "Hong-tao Jin", "org": "Genetic Engineering Laboratory", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e150088fc"}, {"name": "Kuo-shi Jin", "org": "Genetic Engineering Laboratory", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15126bac"}, {"name": "Ying-jiu Zhang", "org": "Key Laboratory for Molecular Enzymology and Engineering of Ministry of Education", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151dca13"}], "title": "Molecular design and immunogenicity of a multiple-epitope FMDV antigen and DNA vaccination", "keywords": ["DNA vaccine", "Foot and mouth disease virus", "Multiple-epitope"], "venue": "Chemical Research in Chinese Universities", "year": 2008, "abstract": "This article reports the design and construction of a multiple-epitope foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) antigen, designated as OAAT.

By analyzing TNF-\u03b1 stimulation-mediated stabilization of si20- and miR16-targeted mRNA, we show that this stabilization is not caused by modifying si20 and miR16 loading into Ago2 complexes, or mRNA targeting to Ago2, but by inhibiting mRNA deadenylation.

Passive immunization of HAV plays an extremely important role in post-exposure prophylaxis with clinical applications often requiring large amounts of antibody. As an alternative to the in vitro production of recombinant proteins, expression of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in the milk of transgenic animals is currently used being associated with low production costs and high activity. In this paper, eight founder lines of transgenic mice were generated by co-microinjection of the two cassettes encoding the heavy- and light-chains of a neutralizing anti-HAV antibody, respectively. The expressed heavy- and light-chains of the mAb were correctly assembled and modified in the mammary gland as detected by western blotting. High expression levels of the antibody were achieved during the lactation period and found to be independent of the copy numbers of integrated transgenes. The highest level was up to 32.2 mg/ml. The binding specificity and neutralizing activity of the expressed mAb were assayed by ELISA and neutralizing test, showing that it is capable to neutralize the JN strain of Hepatitis A virus efficiently. Therefore, our results suggest that a large-scale and efficient production of the anti-HAV mAb in the milk of transgenic farm animals would be feasible in the future. \u00a9 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.", "pid": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e150576b8"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Hao Zhou", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1515221c"}, {"name": "Yaling Tang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1516b6c1"}, {"name": "Xinhua Liang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fa2b05"}, {"name": "Xiaoqin Yang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15006d95"}, {"name": "Jing Yang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e15104e56"}, {"name": "Guiquan Zhu", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e151782cf"}, {"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f85860"}, {"name": "Chunxu Zhang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e1519b88e"}], "title": "RNAi targeting urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor inhibits metastasis and progression of oral squamous cell carcinoma in vivo", "keywords": ["Cancer progression", "Metastasis", "Oral squamous cell carcinoma", "RNA interference", "Urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor"], "venue": "International Journal of Cancer", "year": 2009, "abstract": "It has been admitted that urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (u-PAR) is overexpressed in many human malignant tumors including oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and plays an important role in a variety of cancer key cellular events as a versatile signaling orchestrator. In our study, a retroviral vector expressing u-PAR-specific siRNA was injected into OSCC xenografts of nude mice to observe its inhibitory effects on OSCC. Our data demonstrate that siRNA targeting u-PAR markedly suppressed tumor growth, reduced the expression of proliferation-related gene, Ki-67 and increased cell apoptosis, accompanying with the efficient and specific inhibition of endogenous u-PAR expression in OSCC. More importantly, the mRNA and protein expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, VEGF-C, VEGF-D and VEGFR-3 that are intimately involved in oral cancer invasion and metastasis, was simultaneously downregulated significantly as determined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry; and Gelatin and fibrin zymography showed that MMP-9, MMP-2 and u-PA enzymatic activities were significantly reduced in u-PAR-specific siRNA group, compared to those in control groups. In addition, the expression of MDR-1 gene related to drug resistance was obviously inhibited by silencing of u-PAR. These findings suggest that RNAi targeting u-PAR could effectively inhibit the metastasis and progression of OSCC in vivo. Thus, it may be used as a potent and specific therapy for oral cancer, especially in inhibiting and preventing cancer cell invasion and metastasis. \u00a9 2009 UICC.", "pid": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e15140a9b"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f85860"}, {"name": "Ningyi Jin", "org": "Genetic Engineering Laboratory", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1506813b"}, {"name": "Qi Liu", "org": "Guangxi Center for Animal Disease Control and Prevention", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e151f9a4c"}, {"name": "Xiaowei Huo", "org": "Genetic Engineering Laboratory", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150ae290"}, {"name": "Yang Li", "org": "College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e150339e0"}, {"name": "Bo Hu", "org": "Genetic Engineering Laboratory", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1511d1dd"}, {"name": "Haili Ma", "org": "Genetic Engineering Laboratory", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15012f0f"}, {"name": "Zhanbo Zhu", "org": "Genetic Engineering Laboratory", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fc6f1e"}, {"name": "Yanzhao Cong", "org": "Genetic Engineering Laboratory", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15128512"}, {"name": "Xiao Li", "org": "Genetic Engineering Laboratory", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f9ce38"}, {"name": "Minglan Jin", "org": "Genetic Engineering Laboratory", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1506e6e9"}, {"name": "Guangze Zhu", "org": "Genetic Engineering Laboratory", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e15068ecd"}], "title": "Immunogenicity and protective efficacy of Semliki forest virus replicon-based DNA vaccines encoding goatpox virus structural proteins", "keywords": ["Capripoxvirus", "DNA vaccine", "Goatpox virus", "Immune response", "Replicon DNA", "Semliki forest virus"], "venue": "Virology", "year": 2009, "abstract": "Goatpox, caused by goatpox virus (GTPV), is an acute feverish and contagious disease in goats often associated with high morbidity and high mortality.

Then, theirs ability to induce humoral and cellular response in mice and goats, and protect goats against virulent virus challenge were evaluated. The results showed that, vaccination with pCSm-AAL and pCSm-BAA in combination could elicit strong humoral and cellular responses in mice and goats, provide partial protection against viral challenge in goats, and reduce disease symptoms. Additionally, priming vaccination with the above-mentioned DNA vaccines could significantly reduce the goats' side reactions from boosting vaccinations with current live vaccine (AV41), which include skin lesions at the inoculation site and fevers.

The aim of this study was to delineate the characteristics of victims with maxillofacial fractures in this disaster. Patients and methods: A descriptive analysis was conducted based on the medical records of earthquake maxillofacial injuries casualties transferred to West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, after the earthquake. Data regarding demographic details, psychological status, patterns, anatomic sites, etiology, concomitant injuries, and management of earthquake maxillofacial fractures were evaluated. Results: A total of 46 maxillofacial fracture patients' records of 28 (60.9%) males and 18 (39.1%) females were included in this study, with peak incidence (32.6%) in the elderly age group (older than 50 years). The most common etiology of earthquake maxillofacial fractures was building collapse (71.7%). The mandible (65.2%) was the most frequent site of the maxillofacial fracture, followed by the zygomatic complex (21.7%) and maxilla (13.0%). The most prevalent of maxillofacial fracture pattern was multiple and/or comminuted fractures (56.5%), which accounted for 72.7% (24/33) in building collapse injury group. There were 9 (19.6%) patients with significant concomitant injuries and the most common site of concomitant injuries was the head (4 cases) and extremity (4 cases). Four (8.7%) patients' maxillofacial fractures were treated conservatively, 16 (34.8%) underwent closed reduction and fixation, and 26 (56.5%) underwent open reduction and rigid internal fixation (RIF). Apart from 3 patients (6.5%) who showed infection, all patients with facial fractures achieved successful bony union with an acceptable occlusion and facial form. Additionally, it is noteworthy that all patients in our study presented the symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Conclusion: There is a variation of mechanism of injuries, age group, severity, patterns, concomitant injuries, and management of earthquake maxillofacial fractures. Knowledge of these characteristics provides useful strategies for patient care and prevention of further complications. A multidisciplinary and coordinated approach is important for optimum stabilization and ongoing treatment of victims of building collapse injury. The high percentage of PTSD confirms that psychologists should form an integral part of this multidisciplinary team. \u00a9 2009 Mosby, Inc.

However, patients with chronic hepatitis B usually show low response to IFN-alpha treatment and the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells were used to examine the Type I IFN receptors expression, phosphorylation and methylation of STAT1. STAT1-PIAS1 interaction in cells was tested by protein co-immunoprecipitation. The potential improvement of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) in the antiviral effect of IFN-alpha was also investigated. Our data demonstrated that both chains of the Type I IFN receptors were expressed for a much higher extent in HepG2.2.15 cells than in HepG2 cells. HBV inhibited dramatically the methylation rather than the phosphorylation of STAT1, which was consistent with an increased STAT1-PIAS1 interaction. Combined with IFN-alpha, SAM treatment effectively improved STAT1 methylation and attenuated STAT1-PIAS1 binding, followed by increased PKR and 2\u2032,5\u2032-OAS mRNA expression, thus significantly reducing the HBsAg, HBeAg protein levels and HBV DNA load in the supernatant of HepG2.2.15 cells. Less STAT1 methylation and subsequent increased STAT1-PIAS1 interaction are involved in the mechanism of the IFN-alpha-antagonistic activity of HBV. By improving STAT1 methylation, SAM can enhance the antiviral effect of IFN-alpha. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Study design: Forty patients diagnosed with TMJ OA and 20 healthy control subjects were included in this study. Synovial fluid was collected in the OA group and the healthy group at baseline. The OA patients were randomly divided into 2 groups (20 patients for each group): One group received 5 injections of SH, and the other received 5 injections of physiologic saline solution in the upper joint space at weekly intervals. Synovial fluid was collected before and after treatment. Urokinase-type PA (uPA), soluble uPA receptor (suPAR) and PA inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) levels in synovial fluid were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: The OA patients had significantly higher uPA activity and levels of uPA (median 80.01 ng/L), suPAR (median 7.54 ng/L), and PAI-1 (median 54.9 ng/mL) than the healthy control subjects (median 20.47 ng/L uPA, 2.34 ng/L suPAR, and 19.9 ng/mL PAI-1; (P < .05). The uPA activity and levels of uPA, suPAR, and PAI-1 were significantly decreased after SH injections in TMJs of OA patients (P < .05), and there was no difference after saline injection. Visual analog pain score reduction correlated with changes in uPA and uPAR levels as well as uPA activity. Conclusion: The effects of SH on PA system provide new insight into a possible underlying mechanism by which SH alleviates pain of patients with TMJ OA. \u00a9 2010 Mosby, Inc.

Measuring these events in the context of time and its perturbation by small molecule compounds and RNAi can provide mechanistic information about cellular pathways being affected. We have used impedance-based time-dependent cell response profiling (TCRP) to measure and characterize cellular responses to antimitotic compounds or siRNAs. Our findings indicate that small molecule perturbation of mitosis leads to unique TCRP. We have further used this unique TCRP signature to screen 119\u2032595 compound library and identified novel antimitotic compounds based on clustering analysis of the TCRPs. Importantly, 113 of the 117 hit compounds in the TCRP antimitotic cluster were confirmed as antimitotic based on independent assays, thus establishing the robust predictive nature of this profiling approach. In addition, potent and novel agents that induce mitotic arrest either by directly interfering with tubulin polymerization or by other mechanisms were identified. The TCRP approach allows for a practical and unbiased phenotypic profiling and screening tool for small molecule and RNAi perturbation of specific cellular pathways and time resolution of the TCRP approach can serve as a complement for other existing multidimensional profiling approaches. \u00a9 2010 American Chemical Society.", "pid": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1516dacb"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Chunxu Zhang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e1519b88e"}, {"name": "Yaling Tang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1516b6c1"}, {"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f85860"}, {"name": "Jing Yang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e15104e56"}, {"name": "Guiquan Zhu", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e151782cf"}, {"name": "Hao Zhou", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1515221c"}, {"name": "Zhefeng Zhang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1511a13f"}, {"name": "Xinhua Liang", "org": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fa2b05"}], "title": "Maxillofacial space infection experience in West China: A retrospective study of 212 cases", "keywords": ["Life-threatening complication", "Maxillofacial space infection", "Odontogenic infection", "Risk factor"], "venue": "International Journal of Infectious Diseases", "year": 2010, "abstract": "Objectives: Our objectives were to analyze the clinical features of maxillofacial space infection (MSI) patients admitted to the West China Hospital of Stomatology over a five-year period, and to identify potential risk factors associated with life-threatening complications. Methods: A retrospective medical chart review was performed and the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of patients with MSI were evaluated. Results: A total of 212 patients were enrolled in this study, including 125 males (59.0%) and 87 females (41.0%), with an age range of 1-88 years (median 47.5 years). The most common cause of MSI was odontogenic infection (56.1%). The submandibular space was the space most commonly involved in both single space and multiple space infections (37.5% and 29.1%, respectively). One hundred and two patients (48.1%) self-medicated before admission, and the time from onset of symptoms until presentation was longer in those who self-medicated compared with those who did not (p=0.028). Fifty-seven patients (26.9%) had life-threatening complications and six died (2.8%). In multivariate analysis, age, self-medication, admission temperature, respiratory difficulty, and underlying diseases were found to be risk factors for life-threatening complications. The most common occupation of the patients was farmer (54.7%). Among the farmers, 72.4% had an odontogenic etiology; however, 91.7% of the farmers with odontogenic space infections had not undergone dental treatment before admission. Conclusions: Our experience suggests that the management of MSI should be more aggressive when the above risk factors are present, in order to avoid life-threatening complications. In addition, considering the poor medical conditions in the rural areas of West China, standard dental care and services should be provided in the future to replace self-medication. \u00a9 2009 International Society for Infectious Diseases.", "pid": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f9572a"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Gui-Quan Zhu", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e151782cf"}, {"name": "Ya-Ling Tang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1516b6c1"}, {"name": "Ling Li", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150d62e7"}, {"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f85860"}, {"name": "Jian Jiang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150ef0d8"}, {"name": "Xiao-Yu Li", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fe4bc6"}, {"name": "Si-Xiu Chen", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fc5677"}, {"name": "Xin-Hua Liang", "org": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fa2b05"}], "title": "Hypoxia inducible factor 1\u03b1 and hypoxia inducible factor 2\u03b1 play distinct and functionally overlapping roles in oral squamous cell carcinoma", "venue": "Clinical Cancer Research", "year": 2010, "abstract": "Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the functional difference between hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 in oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC).

This study tested the efficacy of MI-219 against a panel of lung cancer cell lines alone or in combination with MDM2 knockdown, an X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) inhibitor, or a chemotherapeutic drug, etoposide.

Clustering one is to partition the dataset into several clusters and then calculate the Kth nearest neighbor in each cluster which can effectively avoid passing the entire dataset for each calculation. Clustering two is to partition the clusters obtained by clustering one and then prune the partitions as soon as it is determined that it cannot contain outliers which results in substantial savings in computation. Experimental results on both synthetic and real life datasets demonstrate that our algorithm is efficient in large datasets. \u00a9 2010 Springer-Verlag.", "pid": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150e52cb"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Chunming Li", "org": "Department of Dermatology", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15119c8d"}, {"name": "Xiaoyong Man", "org": "Department of Dermatology", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fabe21"}, {"name": "Wei Li", "org": "Department of Dermatology", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151df857"}, {"name": "Jiong Zhou", "org": "Department of Dermatology", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151afd54"}, {"name": "Jiaqi Chen", "org": "Department of Dermatology", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e151152f1"}, {"name": "Suiqing Cai", "org": "Department of Dermatology", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e1510b954"}, {"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "Department of Dermatology", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f85860"}], "title": "Regulation of adhesion by vascular endothelial growth factor in HaCaT cells", "keywords": ["Cell-cell adhesion", "Cell-plate adhesion", "Extracellular signal-regulated kinase", "Vascular endothelial growth factor"], "venue": "Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry", "year": 2011, "abstract": "Cell adhesion is an important process during morphogenesis, differentiation, and homeostasis in cell biology.

Actinic skin damage was examined and recorded by the presence and severity (absent, minimal, moderate, or severe) of overall actinic skin damage and its components (i.e., fine telangiectasia, solar elastosis, and actinic keratoses). Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier methods were applied to explore the associations. A total of 672 cancer deaths, 1500 cardiovascular disease deaths, and 2969 deaths from all causes were documented through the follow-up between 1971 and 1992. After controlling for potential confounding variables, severe overall actinic skin damage was associated with a 45% higher risk for all-cause mortality (95% CI: 1.22, 1.72; P<0.001), moderate overall skin damage with a 20% higher risk (95% CI: 1.08., 1.32; P<0.001), and minimal overall skin damage with no significant mortality difference, when compared to those with no skin damage. Similar results were obtained for all-cause mortality with fine telangiectasia, solar elastosis, and actinic keratoses. The results were similar for cancer and cardiovascular disease mortality. Conclusions: The present study gives an indication of an association of actinic skin damage with cardiovascular disease, cancer and all-cause mortality in white subjects. Given the lack of support in the scientific literature and potential unmeasured confounding factors, this finding should be interpreted with caution. More independent studies are needed before any practical recommendations can be made. \u00a9 2011 He et al.", "pid": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f8313a"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Lin Chen", "org": "Medical College", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151f4ab2"}, {"name": "Xi-Xiang Tang", "org": "Key Laboratory of Marine Biogenetic Resources", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1503213a"}, {"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "Medical College", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f85860"}, {"name": "Zhi-Wei Yi", "org": "Key Laboratory of Marine Biogenetic Resources", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151f70ef"}, {"name": "Xiang Xiao", "org": "Key Laboratory of Marine Biogenetic Resources", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1515f3a2"}, {"name": "Ying-Kun Qiu", "org": "Medical College", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1513b843"}, {"name": "Zhen Wu", "org": "Key Laboratory for Chemical Biology of Fujian Province", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151f43ba"}], "title": "A novel indole alkaloid from deep-sea sediment metagenomic clone-derived Escherichia coli fermentation broth", "keywords": ["deep-sea sediment", "indole alkaloids", "metagenomic clone", "N-{1-[4-(acetylamino)phenyl]-3-hydroxy- 1-(1H-indol-3-yl)propan-2-yl}-2,2-dichloroacetamide"], "venue": "Journal of Asian Natural Products Research", "year": 2011, "abstract": "To explore secondary metabolites in deep-sea sediment metagenomic clone-derived Escherichia coli fermentation broth, different kinds of chromatography methods were used in the isolation procedures, while the structures of the isolated compounds were assigned based on the MS analysis and their 1H and ", "pid": "5b5433e3e1cd8e4e15f4066c"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Yuanyuan Wang", "org": "State Key Laboratory for Agrobiotechnology", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1504e2e8"}, {"name": "Jia Tong", "org": "State Key Laboratory for Agrobiotechnology", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150bf90a"}, {"name": "Shuping Li", "org": "State Key Laboratory for Agrobiotechnology", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151dec46"}, {"name": "Ran Zhang", "org": "State Key Laboratory for Agrobiotechnology", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1510ef55"}, {"name": "Li Chen", "org": "State Key Laboratory for Agrobiotechnology", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fd8a3b"}, {"name": "Yuhui Wang", "org": "Health Science Center", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1507fad8"}, {"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "GenProtein Biotech Ltd.", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f85860"}, {"name": "Meili Wang", "org": "GenProtein Biotech Ltd.", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f4beee"}, {"name": "George Liu", "org": "Health Science Center", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1503b557"}, {"name": "Yunping Dai", "org": "GenProtein Biotech Ltd.", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15113973"}, {"name": "Yaofeng Zhao", "org": "State Key Laboratory for Agrobiotechnology", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e1510363e"}, {"name": "Ning Li", "org": "State Key Laboratory for Agrobiotechnology", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e152064a7"}], "title": "Over-expression of human lipoprotein lipase in mouse mammary glands leads to reduction of milk triglyceride and delayed growth of suckling pups", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "year": 2011, "abstract": "Background: The mammary gland is a conserved site of lipoprotein lipase expression across species and lipoprotein lipase attachment to the luminal surface of mammary gland vascular endothelial cells has been implicated in the direction of circulating triglycerides into milk synthesis during lactation.

Lipoprotein lipase levels in transgenic milk was raised to 0.16 mg/ml, corresponding to an activity of 8772.95 mU/ml. High lipoprotein lipase activity led to a significant reduction of triglyceride concentration in milk, but other components were largely unchanged.

Here we report the generation and initial characterization of transgenic mice that carried a porcine BAC encoding the porcine GH gene. We show that GH expression is restricted specifically to the pituitary, is associated with elevated IGF-1 levels, and results in growth enhancement.

Methods: Concanavalin A (ConA)-induced mouse hepatitis model was used. The mRNA level of RCOR3 in mouse liver was measured using GeneChip array and real-time PCR. One hundred seventy-seven patients with hepatitis B and 34 healthy individuals were categorized into six groups including mild chronic hepatitis, moderate chronic hepatitis B, severe hepatitis B (SHB), cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and healthy control. Serum levels of human RCOR3 were measured using ELISA. Results: In the mouse hepatitis model, the mRNA level of RCOR3 in liver was reduced early after exposure to ConA, then increased after 6 h of exposure. There was no significant difference in the serum RCOR3 level between the mild chronic hepatitis B and the control groups. The serum RCOR3 level was significantly increased in the moderate chronic hepatitis B group, but significantly reduced in SHB, cirrhosis and HCC groups, as compared with the control group. Moreover, the serum RCOR3 levels in SHB, cirrhosis and liver cancer patients were significantly lower than those in the patients with moderate chronic hepatitis B and with mild chronic hepatitis B. Rank correlation analysis revealed a significant correlation between serum RCOR3 level and total bilirubin (r=-0.305, P<0.01). There was no significant correlation between RCOR3 on one hand, and alanine transaminase (r=0.014, P>0.05) or aspartate transaminase (r=-0.079, P>0.05) on the other hand. Conclusion: Serum RCOR3 level may reflect the degree of liver damage, which might be a potential biomarker for the outcome of patients with hepatitis B. \u00a9 2011 CPS and SIMM All rights reserved.", "pid": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e1519a595"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Qi Xia", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Infectious Disease Diagnosis and Treatment", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e15101fad"}, {"name": "An-Mei Deng", "org": "Laboratory Diagnostics", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151b7bbf"}, {"name": "Shan-Shan Wu", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Infectious Disease Diagnosis and Treatment", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151f3cb8"}, {"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Infectious Disease Diagnosis and Treatment", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f85860"}], "title": "Cholera toxin inhibits human hepatocarcinoma cell proliferation in vitro via suppressing ATX/LPA axis", "keywords": ["autotaxin", "cell proliferation", "cholera toxin", "hepatocarcinoma", "lysophosphatidic acid"], "venue": "Acta Pharmacologica Sinica", "year": 2011, "abstract": "Aim: To investigate the antitumor effect of cholera toxin (CT) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in vitro and the mechanisms underlying the effect. Methods: Human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines Hep3B and Huh7, which expressed moderate and high level of autotaxin (ATX), respectively, were used. Cytokine level in the cells was evaluated using ELISA assay, and cell proliferation was investigated using MTT assay. ATX expression was determined using Western blot. ATX/lyso-PLD activity in the conditioned medium was measured using FS-3, a fluorescent lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) analogue, as substrate. Results: Exposure to CT (7.5 and 10 ng/mL) significantly inhibited the cell growth, decreased secretion of proinflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1 and promoted secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-10. CT at 10 ng/mL markedly suppressed ATX expression in Hep3B and Huh7 cells. Furthermore, ATX and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) were found to be crucial for growth of the cancer cells. CT could inhibit TNF-\u03b1-induced expression and secretion of ATX that led to decreased activity of lysophospholipase D, thus decreasing the conversion of LPC to LPA.

To improve our understanding of the molecular basis of this threat, NDM-1 was purified and characterized. Recombinant NDM-1 bearing its native leader sequence was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells. The major processed form found to be released into culture media contains a 35-residue truncation at the N-terminus. This form of NDM-1 is monomeric and can be purified with 1.8 or 1.0 equiv of zinc ion, depending on the experimental conditions.

Moderate dose UVB also promoted tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, this effect was again VEGF independent. Both \u03b1 and \u03b4 isoforms of protein kinase C (PKC) were required for UVB-induced phosphorylation of VEGFR-1, but only the \u03b4 isoform was required for VEGFR-2 phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of VEGFRs or isoforms of PKC was completely inhibited by PP2, a specific inhibitor for Src family kinases (SFKs), indicating that SFKs are upstream of PKC and VEGFRs. Moderate dose UVB-induced VEGF exerted an anti-apoptotic effect for keratinocytes, whereas high dose UVB-induced VEGF played as an inflammatory factor. Of note, neutralization of VEGFR-2 but not VEGFR-1 exacerbated UVB-induced cell death and reduced survival of keratinocytes. Furthermore, VEGFR-2 neutralization inhibited the activation of ERK1/2 and Akt by UVB, suggesting that VEGFR-2 signaling was involved in the pro-survival mechanism via ERK1/2 and PI3-K/Akt pathway. Taken together, we demonstrate for the first time that VEGFR-2 signaling is activated and promotes survival of keratinocytes under moderate dose of UVB irradiation. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Certain studies have demonstrated that NY-ESO-1 predicts tumor recurrence and treatment response. No reports are currently available regarding the correlation between NY-ESO-1 and the recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) following surgery. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the association between NY-ESO-1 and relapse of HCC and to explore the possible mechanisms for this correlation. A total of 120 HCC patients were analyzed for the expression of NY-ESO-1 by immunohistochemistry (IHC). A stable NY-ESO-1 over-expressed HepG2 cell line (ESO-HepG2) was established to determine the biological effects of NY-ESO-1 on cell proliferation, cell cycle and migration by using the xCELLigence DP system, flow cytometry and xCELLigence SP system. NY-ESO-1 was positive in 28 of 120 (23.3%) HCC tumor tissues. NY-ESO-1 was not detectable in adjacent normal liver tissues. A close correlation was found between NY-ESO-1 expression and the recurrence of HCC following surgery (P=0.007). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a shorter recurrence-free survival (RFS) for patients positive for NY-ESO-1 (log-rank test, P=0.003). The Cox regression model demonstrated that NY-ESO-1 expression was a significant independent predictor for the recurrence of HCC following curative surgery (P=0.022). Compared with HepG2 cells, ESO-HepG2 cells have increased migration but not proliferation ability. In conclusion, NY-ESO-1 expression is associated with worse HCC outcome following surgery, and the mechanism for this finding may be that NY-ESO-1 increases tumor cell migration.", "pid": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f984e4"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Xiao-Yong Man", "org": "Department of Dermatology", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fabe21"}, {"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "Department of Dermatology", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f85860"}], "title": "Papules, plaques, and nodules in an immunocompromised patient", "venue": "JAMA - Journal of the American Medical Association", "year": 2012, "pid": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e15131dc9"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Di Tian", "org": "Pathogen Diagnosis and Biosafety Department", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e15193903"}, {"name": "Wanju Zhang", "org": "Pathogen Diagnosis and Biosafety Department", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e15063a1e"}, {"name": "Jing He", "org": "Pathogen Diagnosis and Biosafety Department", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fe315e"}, {"name": "Yi Liu", "org": "Pathogen Diagnosis and Biosafety Department", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f704c3"}, {"name": "Zhigang Song", "org": "Pathogen Diagnosis and Biosafety Department", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f71062"}, {"name": "Zhitong Zhou", "org": "Pathogen Diagnosis and Biosafety Department", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f4c562"}, {"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Infectious Disease Diagnostic and Treatment", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f85860"}, {"name": "Yunwen Hu", "org": "Pathogen Diagnosis and Biosafety Department", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f76e26"}], "title": "Novel, real-time cell analysis for measuring viral cytopathogenesis and the efficacy of neutralizing antibodies to the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "year": 2012, "abstract": "A novel electronic cell sensor array technology, the real-time cell analysis (RTCA) system, was developed to monitor cell events.

Objective: This article provides an overview of our experience using intradermal purse-string suture for round and oval defects in the faciocervical region to ascertain whether purse-string suture closure for such defects can result in good functional and cosmetic outcomes. Methods and Results: We present 63 cases with different skin lesions in the faciocervical area. The defects of the lesions after excision were closed using intradermal purse-string suture. The wounds showed good final healing without obvious adverse events postoperatively. The result of scar assessment using the Vancouver Scar Scale was satisfying, with a total score of only 1.11. The final cosmetic appearance of the healed wounds seemed to be excellent and acceptable as they were always smaller than the original defects, with minimal scarring. Conclusion: Purse-string suture enabled us to repair small, circular wounds easily after excision of skin lesions. It is an excellent alternative to other reconstructions and a rapid, simple method to close skin defects with minimal scarring, achieving an excellent long-term cosmetic and functional outcome. \u00a9 2012 Canadian Dermatology Association.", "pid": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f8e56b"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Ping Wang", "org": "College of Biological Sciences", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15010d62"}, {"name": "Zhi Guo Wei", "org": "College of Animal Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150b721a"}, {"name": "Bo Wen Yan", "org": "College of Biological Sciences", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e150911da"}, {"name": "Tan Huang", "org": "College of Biological Sciences", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15122806"}, {"name": "Ke Mian Gou", "org": "College of Biological Sciences", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150dcc89"}, {"name": "Yun Ping Dai", "org": "College of Biological Sciences", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15113973"}, {"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "College of Biological Sciences", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f85860"}, {"name": "MeiLi Wang", "org": "College of Biological Sciences", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f4beee"}, {"name": "Xue Qian Cheng", "org": "College of Biological Sciences", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e151123a3"}, {"name": "Xi Feng Wang", "org": "College of Biological Sciences", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151a456a"}, {"name": "Chen Xu", "org": "College of Biological Sciences", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151a307e"}, {"name": "Yi Sun", "org": "College of Biological Sciences", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ff433a"}], "title": "Establishment of a transgenic mouse model with liver-specific expression of secretory immunoglobulin D", "keywords": ["HIDS", "liver-specific expression vector", "MVK", "sIgD"], "venue": "Science China Life Sciences", "year": 2012, "abstract": "Mutation of mevalonate kinase (MVK) is thought to account for most cases of hyperimmunoglobulinemia D syndrome (HIDS) with recurrent fever.

We then generated seven founder lines of transgenic mice by co-microinjection, and verified them using genomic PCR and Southern blotting. We detected the expression of csIgD by reverse transcription PCR, quantitative PCR, western blotting, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. We demonstrated that csIgD could be specifically and stably expressed in the liver. We used flow cytometry to show that overexpression of csIgD in the bone marrow and spleen cells had no effect on B cell development. Morphologic and anatomical observation of the transgenic mice revealed skin damage, hepatosplenomegaly, and nephromegaly in some transgenic mice; in these mice, pathological sections showed high levels of cell necrosis and protein-like sediments in the liver, spleen, and kidney.

Method: In vitro we first detected the expression of HIF-2\u03b1, TWIST2, and SIP1 in two ACC cell lines by Western blot and real-time RT-PCR. Then, in vivo, a retrospective investigation of 121 patients with ACC from Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University between 1996 and 2005 was carried out using immunohistochemistry to analyze the association between the expression of these three factors and clinical-pathological factors of patients. Results: The protein and mRNA levels of HIF-2\u03b1, TWIST2, and SIP1 in the high-metastasis cell line (ACC-M) were much higher than those of the low-metastasis cell line (ACC-2). The positive expression of HIF-2\u03b1, TWIST2, and SIP1 (71.07%, 42.98%, and 38.02%, respectively) was associated with the perineural invasion, the local recurrence, and distant metastasis of patients with ACC (P<0.05). The patients with the positive coexpression of the three factors had a lower survival rate than those with the negative expression (P<0.05). Conclusion: It is proposed that the elevated expression of HIF-2\u03b1, TWIST2, and SIP1 can contribute to invasion and metastasis of ACC, and there might be some correlation between the hypoxia microenvironment and EMT in ACC. \u00a9 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.", "pid": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150e7e4a"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Rui Fang", "org": "State Key Laboratory for Agrobiotechnology", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151b2bef"}, {"name": "Yun-Qian Peng", "org": "State Key Laboratory for Agrobiotechnology", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151ade06"}, {"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "Beijing Genprotein Biotechnology Company", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f85860"}, {"name": "Qing-Yong Meng", "org": "State Key Laboratory for Agrobiotechnology", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1505de88"}], "title": "Muscle-specific expression of \u0394-12 and \u03c9-3 fatty acid desaturases and human catalase using \"self-cleaving\" 2A peptides in transgenic mice", "keywords": ["\u0394-12 fatty acid desaturases", "\u03c9-3 fatty acid desaturases", "Human catalase", "Polyunsaturated fatty acids"], "venue": "Progress in Biochemistry and Biophysics", "year": 2012, "abstract": "Essential polyunsaturated fatty acids can not be synthesized in mammals due to the lack of \u0394-12 and \u03c9-3 fatty acid desaturases.

In anagen IV, intense staining for Artemis (Serine516) was detected in basal cells and upper of outer root sheath (ORS) and inner root sheath (IRS). But only upper ORS and lower medulla were stained positive in anagen VI. Upper ORS and lower cortex were positively stained with Artemis (Serine516) in catagen. Based on the phenomenon that the expression of Artemis (Serine516) in mid-anagen and mature anagen was stronger than that in telogen and catagen, we suggest it may take roles in induced growth of mouse hair. \u00a9 Springer-Verlag 2012.", "pid": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f54535"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Wei Li", "org": "Department of Dermatology", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151df857"}, {"name": "Xiao-Yong Man", "org": "Department of Dermatology", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fabe21"}, {"name": "Chun-Ming Li", "org": "Department of Dermatology", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15119c8d"}, {"name": "Jia-Qi Chen", "org": "Department of Dermatology", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e151152f1"}, {"name": "Jiong Zhou", "org": "Department of Dermatology", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151afd54"}, {"name": "Sui-Qing Cai", "org": "Department of Dermatology", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e1510b954"}, {"name": "Zhong-Fa Lu", "org": "Department of Dermatology", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1503cecf"}, {"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "Department of Dermatology", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f85860"}], "title": "VEGF induces proliferation of human hair follicle dermal papilla cells through VEGFR-2-mediated activation of ERK", "keywords": ["Dermal papilla cell", "ERK", "Hair follicle", "Proliferation", "VEGFR-2"], "venue": "Experimental Cell Research", "year": 2012, "abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is one of the strongest regulators of physiological and pathological angiogenesis.

Wound areas were measured and wound shrinkage rates were calculated before wound formation and on the first, third, seventh and eleventh day after wound formation. Skin tissue specimens were collected from the wound, and tissue edema and inflammatory cell infiltration were observed with HE staining under light microscopy. The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and microvascular density (MVD) in wound tissues was detected with immunohistochemical staining. Results: The wound shrinkage rates in sequential combined intervention group and alternate combined intervention group were significantly higher than those in the other groups at the given time point (P < 0.01). Histological observation indicated that the tissue edema and inflammatory cell infiltration in wound in sequential combined intervention group and alternate combined intervention group were mild.

VEGF receptors (VEGFRs) are high-affinity receptors for VEGF and are originally considered specific to endothelial cells. We previously reported that VEGFRs were also constitutively expressed in normal human keratinocytes and overexpressed in psoriatic epidermis. In addition, UVB can activate VEGFRs in normal keratinocytes, and the activated VEGFR-2 signaling is involved in the pro-survival mechanism. Here, we show that VEGFRs were also upregulated and activated by UVA in normal human keratinocytes via PKC, and interestingly, both the activated VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 protected against UVA-induced cell death. As VEGFRs were over-expressed in psoriatic epidermis, we further investigated whether narrowband UVB (NB-UVB) phototherapy or topical halomethasone monohydrate 0.05% cream could affect their expression. Surprisingly, the over-expressed VEGFRs in psoriatic epidermis were significantly attenuated by both treatments. During NB-UVB therapy, VEGFRs declined first in the basal, and then gradually in the upper psoriatic epidermis. VEGFRs were activated in psoriatic epidermis, their activation was enhanced by NB-UVB, but turned undetectable after whole therapy. This process was quite different from that by halomethasone, in which VEGFRs and phospho-VEGFRs decreased in a gradual, homogeneous manner. Our findings further suggest that UV-induced activation of VEGFRs serves as a pro-survival signal for keratinocytes. In addition, VEGFRs may be involved in the pathological process of psoriasis, and UV phototherapy is effective for psoriasis by directly modulating the expression of VEGFRs. \u00a9 2013 Zhu et al.", "pid": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151cc23c"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f85860"}, {"name": "Jing Zhu", "org": "Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e15077737"}, {"name": "Tiewei Lv", "org": "Department of Cardiology", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150bdd88"}, {"name": "Lingjuan Liu", "org": "Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1518131f"}, {"name": "Huichao Sun", "org": "Department of Cardiology", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e15050376"}, {"name": "Jie Tian", "org": "Department of Cardiology", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15facef2"}], "title": "Bone morphogenetic protein-2 enhances the expression of cardiac transcription factors by increasing histone H3 acetylation in H9c2 cells", "keywords": ["Bone morphogenetic protein-2", "Cardiac transcription factors", "Histone acetylation", "P300"], "venue": "Molecular Medicine Reports", "year": 2013, "abstract": "Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 induces the expression of cardiac transcription factors during early heart development, however, the underlying mechanisms for this are not clear.

In addition, HBx protein has been reported to play a key role in virus-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis. Therefore, the present study aims to investigate the role of HBx in the drug-resistance of HBV-related HCC and examine whether such drug-resistance can be reversed by IFN-\u03b1 treatment. Methods. We established HBx-expressing cells by liposome-mediated transfection of HBx into the Huh7 cell line. MTT, Annexin V/PI, and cell cycle assay were used for determining the cellular growth inhibition, apoptosis, and growth arrest, respectively, after treatment with chemical drug. We further used tumor-bearing mice model to compare the tumor growth inhibition efficacy of ADM and 5-FU between the Huh7-HBx group and the control group, as well as the ADM + IFN-\u03b1 or ADM + IMD treated group and the ADM treated group. SQ-Real time-PCR was performed to analyze the expression of MDR-associated genes and anti-apoptotic genes. Moreover, immunofluorescence and Western blotting were used to determine the subcellular localization of p65 and the phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1. Results: The IC\u00a7ssub\u00a7 50\u00a7esub\u00a7 values of Huh7-HBx cells against ADM and Amn were 2.317 and 1.828-folds higher than those of Huh7-3.1 cells, respectively. The apoptosis ratio and growth arrest was significantly lower in Huh7-HBx cells after treatment with ADM. The in vivo experiment also confirmed that the Huh7-HBx group was much more resistant to ADM or 5-FU than the control. Furthermore, the expression of MDR-associated genes, such as MDR1, MRP1, LRP1, and ABCG2, were significantly up-regulated in Huh7-HBx cells, and the NF-\u03baB pathway was activated after HBx gene transfection in Huh7 cells. However, combined with IFN-\u03b1 in ADM treatment, the HBx induced drug-resistance in Huh7-HBx cells can be partly abolished in in vitro and in vivo models. Moreover, we found that the NF-\u03baB canonical pathway was affected by IFN-\u03b1 treatment, and the expression of anti-apoptotic genes, such as Gadd45\u03b2, Survivin, and c-IAP-1 was down-regulated by IFN-\u03b1 treatment in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusions: HBx protein can induce MDR of HBV-related HCC by activating the NF-\u03baB pathway, which can be partly abolished by IFN-\u03b1 treatment. \u00a9 2013 Liu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "pid": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f8f821"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Xiao-Yong Man", "org": "Department of Dermatology", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fabe21"}, {"name": "Wei Li", "org": "Department of Dermatology", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e15104382"}, {"name": "Jia-Qi Chen", "org": "Department of Dermatology", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e151152f1"}, {"name": "Jiong Zhou", "org": "Department of Dermatology", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151afd54"}, {"name": "Lilla Landeck", "org": "Department of Dermatology", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f6eef9"}, {"name": "Kai-Hong Zhang", "org": "Department of Dermatology", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1504b225"}, {"name": "Zhen Mu", "org": "Department of Dermatology", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1517745b"}, {"name": "Chun-Ming Li", "org": "Department of Dermatology", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15119c8d"}, {"name": "Sui-Qing Cai", "org": "Department of Dermatology", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e1510b954"}, {"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "Department of Dermatology", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f85860"}], "title": "Impaired nuclear translocation of glucocorticoid receptors: Novel findings from psoriatic epidermal keratinocytes", "keywords": ["Glucocorticoid receptor", "Keratinocyte", "Nuclear translocation", "Psoriasis"], "venue": "Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences", "year": 2013, "abstract": "Psoriasis is a chronic proliferative skin disease and is usually treated with topical glucocorticoids, which act through the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a component of the physiological systems essential for immune responses, differentiation, and homeostasis. To investigate the possible role of GR in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, normal and psoriatic lesional skin were recruited. Firstly, the immunolocalization of GR in the skin and cultured epidermal keratinocytes were determined by immunofluorescence. In normal skin and cultured human epidermal keratinocytes, intracellular GR is localized in the nuclei, while in psoriatic skin and cultured keratinocytes, GR is in the cytoplasm. Next, we investigated possible factors associated with the cytoplasmic distribution. We found that VEGF and IFN-\u03b3 led to impaired nuclear translocation of GR through p53 and microtubule-inhibitor, vincristine, and inhibited nuclear uptake of GR in normal keratinocytes. In addition to dexamethasone, interleukin (IL)-13 was also able to transfer GR into nuclei of psoriatic keratinocytes. Furthermore, discontinuation of dexamethasone induced cytoplasmic retention of GR in normal keratinocytes. In contrast, energy depletion of normal epidermal keratinocytes did not change the nuclear distribution of GR. To confirm our findings in vivo, an imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like skin mouse model was included. IL-13 ameliorated (but vincristine exacerbated) the skin lesions on the mouse. Taken together, our findings define that impaired nuclear translocation of GR is associated with VEGF, IFN-\u03b3, p53, and microtubule. Therapeutic strategies designed to accumulate GR in the nucleus, such as IL-13, may be beneficial for the therapy of psoriasis. \u00a9 2013 Springer Basel.", "pid": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1502e4d7"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "Department of Nursing", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f85860"}, {"name": "Xiu-Ni Gan", "org": "Department of Nursing", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151ef0d6"}], "title": "Optimization of working conditions for topical oxygen therapy (TOT) combined with vacuum-assisted closure (VAC)intervention wound of III period pressure ulcer healing in guinea pig model", "keywords": ["Guinea pig", "Pressure ulcer", "Topical oxygen therapy", "Uniform design", "Vacuum-assisted closure"], "venue": "Fudan University Journal of Medical Sciences", "year": 2013, "abstract": "Objective: To study the best working conditions for topical oxygen therapy(TOT) combined vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) intervention of III period pressure ulcer in guinea pig model. Methods: By using uniform design method, with daily average of wound shinkage rate as main investigate target, we investigated intervention frequency, one hour TOT intervention time, intensity of negative pressure and oxygen flow of TOT combined VAC intervention therapy from multi-factor and multi-level. We selected 23 clean male white guinea pigs, then constructed III period pressure ulcers in the left trochanter major of guinea pigs. According to the uniform experiment design, 20 stage III pressure ulcers were divided randomly into 10 groups (n=2). Each experimental group wound was treated with different ratio of TOT combined TOT intervention. After 7 days of continuous intervention, daily average of wound shinkage rate was calculated and analyzed. The best working conditions for TOT combined VAC intervention were selected. Then, validation experiments were carried out in 3 stage III pressure ulcer in guinea pigs under optimal working conditions. Results: Statistical analysis showed that, the significant factors affecting daily average of wound shinkage rate were determined as follows: intervention frequency, one hour TOT intervention time, oxygen flow. Intensity of negative pressure effects on the experimental results was not significant, but could be retained as VAC essential parameters and fixed at -125 mmHg.

The role of microtubules in these essential cellular processes depends on the spatial arrangement of the microtubules. Cortical microtubules are reoriented in response to changes in cell growth status and cell shape. Therefore, an understanding of the mechanism that underlies the change in microtubule orientation will provide insight into plant cell growth and morphogenesis. This study demonstrated that AUGMIN subunit8 (AUG8) in Arabidopsis thaliana is a novel microtubule plus-end binding protein that participates in the reorientation of microtubules in hypocotyls when cell elongation slows down. AUG8 bound to the plus ends of microtubules and promoted tubulin polymerization in vitro. In vivo, AUG8 was recruited to the microtubule branch site immediately before nascent microtubules branched out. It specifically associated with the plus ends of growing cortical microtubules and regulated microtubule dynamics, which facilitated microtubule reorientation when microtubules changed their growth trajectory or encountered obstacle microtubules during microtubule reorientation. This study thus reveals a novel mechanism underlying microtubule reorientation that is critical for modulating cell elongation in Arabidopsis. \u00a9 2013 American Society of Plant Biologists.

Furthermore, the regulation of involucrin by interleukin (IL)-13, IL-17A, endothelin (ET)-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, and interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 was investigated by Western blot. Extracellular regulate protein kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) and glycogen syntheses kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2) inhibitors were also included to define the roles of these signals in the production of involucrin in both psoriatic and normal keratinocytes. In psoriatic lesional skin, involucrin was detected in the stratum spinosum, but not in the basal or the cornified layer. In normal skin, involucrin was restricted to the granular layer and the upper stratum spinosum. IL-13, IL-17A, ET-1, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3 up-regulate expression of involucrin in both psoriatic and normal keratinocytes.

The intravenous injection of Concanavalin A (Con A) was used to establish a mouse model of ALF. The dynamic pro-inflammatory properties and MHC II expression of KCs were measured by qRT-PCR and flow cytometry. HMGB1 expression in KCs was measured by qRT-PCR and Western blotting. The immunofluorescence was implemented to determine the relocation of HMGB1 in KCs, and the siRNA against HMGB1 was utilized to assess the impact of HMGB1 on KC pro-inflammatory properties. The peak of pro-inflammatory cytokines production and MHC II expression in KCs appeared at the early stage of ALF. The up-regulation of HMGB1 expression and the translocation of HMGB1 in KCs were in parallel with the early activation of KCs. The blockade of intracellular HMGB1 expression caused by siRNA significantly inhibited the production of KC-derived pro-inflammatory cytokines, and led to a down-regulation of MAP kinase activation in KCs.

These results suggested that the mechanical induction of uPA, tPA and uPAR upregulated PA activity, which may provide a proteolytic environment of extracellular matrix components and subsequently contribute to the cartilage degradation in TMJ osteoarthritis.", "pid": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1502ac49"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Jingli Liu", "org": "Key Laboratory of Green Chemistry and Technology", "id": "5b5433e3e1cd8e4e15f48b31"}, {"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "Key Laboratory of Green Chemistry and Technology", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f85860"}, {"name": "Chunchun Zhang", "org": "Testing and Analytical Center", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1503a016"}, {"name": "Dingguo Xu", "org": "Key Laboratory of Green Chemistry and Technology", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e1519db18"}], "title": "Amide resonance in the catalysis of 1,2-\u03b1-l-fucosidase from bifidobacterium bifidum", "venue": "Journal of Physical Chemistry B", "year": 2013, "abstract": "Bifidobacterium is a genus of Gram-positive bacteria, which is important in the absorption of nourishment from the human milk oligosaccharides (HMO).

In this work, first, the structure of NDM-1 in complex with the inhibitor molecule l-captopril is investigated by both density functional theory (DFT) and hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) methods, and the theoretical results are in good agreement with the X-ray structure. The Michaelis structure with an antibiotic compound (ampicillin) bound in the active site is constructed from a recent X-ray structure of the NDM-1 enzyme with hydrolyzed ampicillin. It is further simulated using a QM/MM molecular dynamics method. One of the interesting binding features of ampicillin in the NDM-1 active site is that the conserved C3 carboxylate group is not ligated with Zn2 but rather is only hydrogen-bonded with N220 and K211. A bridging hydroxide ion is suggested to connect two zinc cofactors. This hydroxide ion is also hydrogen-bonded with D124. Subsequent reaction path calculations indicate that the initial step of lactam ring-opening occurs through a concerted step in which the cleavage of the C-N bond and the transfer of the hydrogen bond to D124 are nearly concerted.

Cultured rat H9c2 embryonic cardiac myocytes (H9c2 cells) were transfected with recombinant adenoviruses expressing human BMP2 (AdBMP2) with or without curcumin, a specific p300-HAT inhibitor. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that curcumin substantially inhibited both AdBMP2-induced and basal expression levels of cardiac transcription factors GATA4 and MEF2C, but not Tbx5. Similarly, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis showed that curcumin inhibited both AdBMP2-induced and basal histone H3 acetylation levels in the promoter regions of GATA4 and MEF2C, but not of Tbx5.

We have studied the link between the anti-inflammatory effects of Res and the high mobility group box 1(HMGB1) signaling pathway. Methods: Murine macrophage-like RAW264.7 cells (RAW264.7 cells) were either untreated (control) or treated with Res, LPS, or LPS + Res. Levels of IL-6, NO, and TNF- were measured by ELISA and colorimetric assays. Expression of HMGB1 was detected by qRT-PCR, western blot, and immunofluorescence assays. Protein and mRNA expression levels of TLR4 were also examined. Results: Res significantly reduced the levels of IL-6, NO, and TNF- in RAW264.7 cells exposed to LPS. Expression levels of HMGB1 (mRNA and protein) and of TLR4 in the LPS + Res-treated cells were lower than in cells treated with LPS alone. Conclusions: Res can block the inflammatory effects induced by LPS in RAW264.7 cells. Down-regulation of HMGB expression may be one of the mechanisms of action of Res. Res may also influence TLR4 expression in the HMGB1-TLR4 signaling pathway. \u00a9 2014 S.

However, the mechanisms by which CD11b+Gr-1+ myeloid cells recruit to the tumor site have not been well clarified. In the present study, we showed that hypoxia could stimulate the migration of CD11b+Gr-1+ myeloid cells through increased production of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) by head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1)- and HIF-2\u03b1-dependent MIF regulated chemotaxis, differentiation, and pro-angiogenic function of CD11b+Gr-1+ myeloid cells through binding to CD74/CXCR2, and CD74/CXCR4 complexes, and then activating p38/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathways. Knockdown (KD) of HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 in HNSCC cells decreased MIF level but failed to inhibit the CD11b+Gr-1+ myeloid cell migration, because HIF-1\u03b1/2\u03b1 KD enhanced nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) activity that increased IL-6 secretion. Simultaneously blocking NF-\u03baB and HIF-1\u03b1/HIF-2\u03b1 had better inhibitory effect on CD11b+Gr-1+ myeloid cell recruitment in the hypoxic zone than individually silencing HIF-1\u03b1/2\u03b1 or NF-\u03baB. In conclusion, the interaction between HIF-\u03b1/MIF and NF-\u03baB/IL-6 axes plays an important role in the hypoxia-induced accumulation of CD11b+Gr-1+ myeloid cells and tumor growth in HNSCC. \u00a9 2014 Neoplasia Press, Inc.

Increase public awareness of stroke warning signs may help to activate emergency medical services and reduce prehospital delay. Our objectives were to survey the recognition of stroke warning signs among residents of Yuzhong District in Chongqing, China, and determine the proportion of these residents who would make an emergency call (120, in China) if suddenly faced with unexpected stroke warning signs and analyze the relationship between recognition of stroke warning signs and the response of calling for emergency assistance. Methods: In 2011, a population-based face-to-face interview survey using a multistage sampling method was conducted in Yuzhong District, Chongqing. We assessed residents' recognition of stroke warning signs and the proportion of those who would call the emergency number, 120, if suddenly encountering unexpected stroke warning signs. The association between the knowledge of stroke warning signs and activation of 120 was examined. Results: A total of 1101 participants completed the questionnaire. Only 15.6% of respondents knew all 5 stroke warning signs; 17.6% reported that they would call 120 for all 5 stroke warning signs. Recognition of stroke warning signs was associated with the response of calling 120 (odds ratios, 1.92-3.34). Even among those who knew all 5 warning signs of stroke, only 35.5% (95% confidence interval, 28.3-42.6) would call 120 for all 5 signs. Conclusions: Residents of the examined district in Chongqing exhibited low recognition of stroke warning signs and low awareness of appropriate emergency responses to stroke-related symptoms. \u00a9 2014 by National Stroke Association.", "pid": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f4d75a"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Cui-Cui Liu", "org": "Departments of Dermatology, Second Affi liated Hospital, Zhejiang University", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151dfbec"}, {"name": "Lilla Landeck", "org": "University of Osnabrueck", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f6eef9"}, {"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "Departments of Dermatology, Second Affi liated Hospital, Zhejiang University", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f85860"}], "title": "Tick bite", "venue": "Indian Journal of Dermatology, Venereology and Leprology", "year": 2014, "pid": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15119fa3"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Jian-Wei Zhu", "org": "Department of Dermatology, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e151759a5"}, {"name": "Zhong-Fa Lu", "org": "Department of Dermatology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150cd576"}, {"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "Department of Dermatology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f85860"}], "title": "Acquired progressive lymphangioma in the inguinal area mimicking giant condyloma acuminatum", "venue": "Cutis", "year": 2014, "pid": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e1500c4af"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Li-Ming Huang", "org": "Department of Chemotherapy, First Affiliated Hospital, Fujian Medical University", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f86d2b"}, {"name": "Xi Shi", "org": "Department of Chemotherapy, First Affiliated Hospital, Fujian Medical University", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e1520d4e8"}, {"name": "Dan-Fang Yan", "org": "Department of Radiation Oncology, First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151a98d2"}, {"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "Department of Chemotherapy, First Affiliated Hospital, Fujian Medical University", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f85860"}, {"name": "Yu-Jie Deng", "org": "Department of Chemotherapy, First Affiliated Hospital, Fujian Medical University", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e1521094f"}, {"name": "Wu-Cha Zeng", "org": "Department of Chemotherapy, First Affiliated Hospital, Fujian Medical University", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15ff1f1c"}, {"name": "Chen Liu", "org": "Department of Chemotherapy, First Affiliated Hospital, Fujian Medical University", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1506d18f"}, {"name": "Xue-De Lin", "org": "Department of Chemotherapy, First Affiliated Hospital, Fujian Medical University", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1514bdc2"}], "title": "Association between ERCC2 polymorphisms and glioma risk: A meta-analysis", "keywords": ["ERCC2", "Glioma", "Meta-analysis", "Polymorphism"], "venue": "Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention", "year": 2014, "abstract": "ERCC2 is an essential component of the nucleotide excision repair pathway which is involved in the effective maintenance of genome integrity.

The role of decorin, as a representative SLRP, in hair follicle morphogenesis has not been elucidated. We present our initial findings on decorin expression patterns during induced murine hair follicle (HF) cycles. It was found that decorin expression is exclusively restricted to the epidermis, outer root sheath and sebaceous glands during the anagen phase, which correlates with the upregulation of decorin mRNA and protein expression in depilated murine dorsal skin. Furthermore, we used a functional approach to investigate the effects of recombinant human decorin (rhDecorin) via cutaneous injection into HFs at various murine hair cycle stages. The local injection of rhDecorin (100 \u03bcg/ml) into the hypodermis of depilated C57BL/6 mice at anagen delayed catagen progression. In contrast, rhDecorin injection during the telogen phase caused the premature onset of anagen, as demonstrated by the assessment of the following parameters: (i) hair shaft length, (ii) follicular bulbar diameter, (iii) hair follicle cycling score and (iv) follicular phase percentage. Taken together, our results suggest that decorin may modulate follicular cycling and morphogenesis.

Our previous studies showed that BMP2 enhanced the expression of cardiac transcription factors in part by increasing histone H3 acetylation. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that Smad4 mediated BMP2 signaling pathway is essential for the expression of cardiac core transcription factors by affecting the histone H3 acetylation. We successfully constructed a lentivirus-mediated short hairpin RNA interference vector targeting Smad4 (Lv-Smad4) in rat H9c2 embryonic cardiac myocytes (H9c2 cells) and demonstrated that it suppressed the expression of the Smad4 gene. Cultured H9c2 cells were transfected with recombinant adenoviruses expressing human BMP2 (AdBMP2) with or without Lv-Smad4. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that knocking down of Smad4 substantially inhibited both AdBMP2-induced and basal expression levels of cardiac transcription factors GATA4 and Nkx2.5, but not MEF2c and Tbx5. Similarly, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis showed that knocking down of Smad4 inhibited both AdBMP2-induced and basal histone H3 acetylation levels in the promoter regions of GATA4 and Nkx2.5, but not of Tbx5 and MEF2c. In addition, Lv-Smad4 selectively suppressed AdBMP2-induced expression of HAT p300, but not of HAT GCN5 in H9c2 cells. The data indicated that inhibition of Smad4 diminished both AdBMP2 induced and basal histone acetylation levels in the promoter regions of GATA4 and Nkx2.5, suggesting that Smad4 mediated BMP2 signaling pathway was essential for the regulation of GATA4 and Nkx2.5 by affecting the histone H3 acetylation in H9c2 cells. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In a previous study, we demonstrated that ethanol exposure could lead to histone hyperacetylation and Gata4 over-expression in fetal mouse hearts. However, the potential mechanisms of histone hyperacetylation and Gata4 over-expression induced by ethanol remain unclear. Methods and Results: Pregnant mice were gavaged with ethanol or saline. Fetal mouse hearts were collected for analysis. The results of ethanol fed groups showed that global HAT activity was unusually high in the hearts of fetal mice while global HDAC activity remained unchanged. Binding of P300, CBP, PCAF, SRC1, but not GCN5, were increased on the Gata4 promoter relative to the saline treated group. Increased acetylation of H3K9 and increased mRNA expression of Gata4, \u03b1-MHC, cTnT were observed in these hearts. Treatment with the pan-histone acetylase inhibitor, anacardic acid, reduced the binding of P300, PCAF to the Gata4 promoter and reversed H3K9 hyperacetylation in the presence of ethanol. Interestingly, anacardic acid attenuated over-expression of Gata4, \u03b1-MHC and cTnT in fetal mouse hearts exposed to ethanol. Conclusions: Our results suggest that P300 and PCAF may be critical regulatory factors that mediate Gata4 over-expression induced by ethanol exposure. Alternatively, P300, PCAF and Gata4 may coordinate over-expression of cardiac downstream genes in mouse hearts exposed to ethanol. Anacardic acid may thus protect against ethanol-induced Gata4, \u03b1-MHC, cTnT over-expression by inhibiting the binding of P300 and PCAF to the promoter region of these genes. \u00a9 2014 Peng et al.", "pid": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15feaba8"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Xuede Lin", "org": "Department of Chemotherapy, The First Affiliated Hospital, Fujian Medical University", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1514bdc2"}, {"name": "Xi Shi", "org": "Department of Chemotherapy, The First Affiliated Hospital, Fujian Medical University", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e1520d4e8"}, {"name": "Wucha Zeng", "org": "Department of Chemotherapy, The First Affiliated Hospital, Fujian Medical University", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15ff1f1c"}, {"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "Department of Chemotherapy, The First Affiliated Hospital, Fujian Medical University", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f85860"}, {"name": "Liming Huang", "org": "Department of Chemotherapy, The First Affiliated Hospital, Fujian Medical University", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f86d2b"}], "title": "Salvage therapy with mitoxantrone, Etoposide, Bleomycin and dexamethasone for refractory or relapsed aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients with a poor performance status or comorbidity", "keywords": ["Comorbidity", "Mitoxantrone", "Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma", "Poor performance status", "Salvage therapy"], "venue": "Oncology Letters", "year": 2014, "abstract": "The treatment of refractory or relapsed aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in patients in a state of poor health is difficult due to their ineligibility to receive intensive salvage chemotherapy.

The objective of this study was to discuss the characteristics of lower limb vascular angiopathy and plaque formation in type 2 diabetes patients and finding its relevance to the carotid atherosclerotic plaque formation, thus directing the clinical diagnosis and treatment. Methods: The ultrasonography was used to monitor the patients with carotid artery and lower limb artery. Results: Compared with the control group, decreased blood flow to lower limb and lower limb angiopathy occurred more obviously in dorsal artery of foot than in popliteal artery. The study revealed that the detection rate of the prevalence of carotid atherosclerosis plaque and lower limb arterial plaque and the combination of plaque both carotid and lower limb arteries in diabetic patients was 369:342:296 (about 1.25:1.15:1) and that the prevalence of carotid plaque and lower limb arterial plaque in all subjects with plaque was 71.3%. The risk of plaque formation also had positive correlation with patient\u2019s age. Color Doppler ultrasound had a clinical significance in the early diagnosis and curative effect observation in type 2 diabetes with lower limb angiopathy. The risk of simultaneous plaque formation in both carotid artery and lower extremity artery was greater in type 2 diabetes than that of control subjects, but they were not necessarily to occur simultaneously. The symptoms were inconspicuous in the early course of diabetes.

TWIST2, an important transcription factor of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), plays a critical role in the tumor progression and metastasis. The role of TWIST2 in tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) and its association with hyperthermia still have not been reported. Method: The correlations between TWIST2 expression and the clinical-pathologic characteristics of 89 patients with TSCC were evaluated by immunohistochemical staining. TSCC cell lines transfected with siRNA against TWIST2 were heated for 40 min at 42.5\u00b0C, and the migration capability of cells was examined by migration assay. Xenograft tumors in nude mice were treated by hyperthermia, and TWIST2 expression was measured. Results: Our data showed that TWIST2 expression was associated with the metastasis of human TSCC. In Tca8113 and Cal-27 cells, TWIST2-siRNA treatment can reduce cell migration ability and has no effect on the cell proliferation and apoptosis. Hyperthermia can decrease the level of TWIST2 in TSCC and inhibit the migration of cells.

Our results suggest that in concert with but independent of innate immune response, recognition of cytosolic DNA induced cellular energy stress potentially functions as a metabolic barrier to viral replication.", "pid": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1513ba17"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "Institute of Materials Physical Chemistry, Huaqiao University", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f85860"}, {"name": "Jinghao Huo", "org": "Institute of Materials Physical Chemistry, Huaqiao University", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fb76fd"}, {"name": "Yongguang Tu", "org": "Institute of Materials Physical Chemistry, Huaqiao University", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e1520fa29"}, {"name": "Jihuai Wu", "org": "Institute of Materials Physical Chemistry, Huaqiao University", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fc30f8"}, {"name": "Linhua Hu", "org": "Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, CAS", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f9f152"}, {"name": "Songyuan Dai", "org": "Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, CAS", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1518aa9e"}], "title": "Flowerlike molybdenum sulfide/multi-walled carbon nanotube hybrid as Pt-free counter electrode used in dye-sensitized solar cells", "keywords": ["counter electrode", "Dye-sensitized solar cell", "molybdenum sulfide", "multi-walled carbon nanotubes"], "venue": "Electrochimica Acta", "year": 2015, "abstract": "Abstract A flowerlike molybdenum sulfide/multi-walled carbon nanotube (MoS<inf>2</inf>/MWCNT) hybrid is prepared and used as an efficient Pt-free counter electrode (CE) for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).

This investigation was performed to address the subcellular localization of PTTG1 and its possible involvement in proliferative skin diseases. In vitro primary-cultured keratinocytes and skin samples from psoriasis, seborrheic keratosis (SK), basal cell carcinoma (BCC), and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) were investigated by immunofluorescence and real-time PCR. In normal skin, PTTG1 is localized predominantly in 10% of basal keratinocytes, while 30-40% in basal and suprabasal psoriatic keratinocytes. PTTG1 mRNA in psoriatic epidermis is about 5-fold more than that in normal one (P<0.01). PTTG1 is localized in cytoplasm in primary-cultured normal and psoriatic keratinocytes, and PTTG1 in HaCaT cells is distributed throughout the cytoplasm of metaphase cells. PTTG1 is seen at both G2 and M phases, and highest PTTG1 expression correlates with highest cyclin B1 expression and highest degree of nuclear pleomorphism at M phase. The positive rate of PTTG1 in SK, BCC, and SCC is about 10%, 20%, and more than 80%, respectively. PTTG1 siRNA, which knocks down the expression of PTTG1, reduced the invasive capacity of A431 cells.

The Rheb\u2011mTORC1 axis is a pivotal pathway that mediates cell growth. It was previously reported that upon energy\u2011stress stimulation, the phosphorylation of Rheb at serine 130 by p38\u2011regulated/activated protein kinase (PRAK) results in the impaired nucleotide binding ability of Rheb and inhibits Rheb\u2011mediated mTORC1 activation. However, the role of Rheb phosphorylation in cancer development remains to be elucidated. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of Rheb phosphorylation on tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. In addition, tissue samples were obtained from 70 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients in order to determine any associations between Rheb phosphorylation and the clinicopathological characteristics of patients. In vitro and ex vivo kinase assays were performed to determine the phosphorylation of Rheb by PRAK. A xenograft assay was performed to assess tumorigenicity of MEF cell lines. In addition, western blot and immunohistochemical analyses were performed to detect Rheb protein expression and phosphorylation. The results of the present study revealed that Rheb phosphorylation may be induced through Ras overexpression. In addition, kinase\u2011dead PRAK and dominant\u2011negative PRAK mutation were demonstrated to abolish the Rheb phosphorylation induced by Ras overexpression. Xenograft assays in nude mice revealed that Rheb phosphorylation was involved in PRAK\u2011mediated tumor suppression.

However, significantly increased expression of Vim, FN, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) and Slug was seen.

As for the four copolymers, the absorption and emission spectra were blue shifted and the fluorescence quantum efficiency improved with the increase of the non-substituted PPV content. These copolymers possess both the good solubility of MEH-PPV and the high fluorescence efficiency of PPV. Additionally, the chemical structures of these copolymers can be controlled. The emission of the copolymer films changed with the thickness of the films, which may be caused by the interaction between the two different chains of MEH-PPV and PPV on the copolymer backbone. The most important is that a laser-like emission was observed from MEH-PPV neat film, which suggested that PPVs would be very promising laser materials.

Therefore, low cost, highly sensitive sensors for the determination of Cr(VI) are highly demanded. It is well-known that highly luminescent carbon dots (CDs) have been successfully applied as fluorescent nanosensors for pH, ions, and molecular substances. In the present work, we have demonstrated an on-off fluorescent CD probe for detecting Cr(VI) based on the inner filter effect (IFE) because the absorption bands of Cr(IV) fully covered the emission and excitation bands of CDs. This CD-based nanosensor provides obvious advantages of simplicity, convenience, rapid response, high selectivity, and sensitivity, which have potential application for the detection of Cr(VI) in the environmental industry. In addition, because Cr(VI) can be reduced to low valent chromium species easily by reductant, resulting in the elimination of the IFE and recovery of CD fluorescence, the CD-Cr(VI) mixture could behave as an off-on type fluorescent probe for reductant. We employed ascorbic acid (AA) as an example molecule to demonstrate this off-on type fluorescent probe. \u00a9 2013 American Chemical Society.", "pid": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150dab4c"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Zhensheng Li", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Polymer Physics and Chemistry, Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fb5d4e"}, {"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Luminescence and Applications, Changchun Institute of Optics, Fine Mechanics and Physics, CAS", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1509c640"}, {"name": "Xingang Guan", "org": "Life Science Research Center, Beihua University", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fc47f2"}, {"name": "Zhigang Xie", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Polymer Physics and Chemistry, Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ff4460"}, {"name": "Yubin Huang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Polymer Physics and Chemistry, Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151dafed"}, {"name": "Xiabin Jing", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Polymer Physics and Chemistry, Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e1501112c"}], "title": "Unadulterated BODIPY-dimer nanoparticles with high stability and good biocompatibility for cellular imaging", "venue": "Nanoscale", "year": 2014, "abstract": "Purely organic nanoparticles based on a BODIPY dimer, BDY-NPs, have been prepared for the first time using a nanoprecipitation procedure.

Here a series of GQDs were synthesized under hydrothermal processes in order to investigate the formation process and optical properties of N-doped GQDs. Citric acid (CA) was used as a carbon precursor and self-assembled into sheet structure in a basic condition and formed N-free GQD graphite framework through intermolecular dehydrolysis reaction. N-doped GQDs were prepared using a series of N-containing bases such as urea. Detailed structural and property studies demonstrated the formation mechanism of N-doped GQDs for tunable optical emissions. Hydrothermal conditions promote formation of amide between-NH 2 and-COOH with the presence of amine in the reaction. The intramoleculur dehydrolysis between neighbour amide and COOH groups led to formation of pyrrolic N in the graphene framework. Further, the pyrrolic N transformed to graphite N under hydrothermal conditions. N-doping results in a great improvement of PL quantum yield (QY) of GQDs. By optimized reaction conditions, the highest PL QY (94%) of N-doped GQDs was obtained using CA as a carbon source and ethylene diamine as a N source. The obtained N-doped GQDs exhibit an excitation-independent blue emission with single exponential lifetime decay. \u00a9 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.", "pid": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fa8af7"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Li Quan", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Polymer Physics and Chemistry, Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150ff243"}, {"name": "Tingting Sun", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Polymer Physics and Chemistry, Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1511703f"}, {"name": "Wenhai Lin", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Polymer Physics and Chemistry, Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fb6744"}, {"name": "Xingang Guan", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Polymer Physics and Chemistry, Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fc47f2"}, {"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Luminescence and Applications, Changchun Institute of Optics, Fine Mechanics and Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1509c640"}, {"name": "Zhigang Xie", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Polymer Physics and Chemistry, Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ff4460"}, {"name": "Xiabin Jing", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Polymer Physics and Chemistry, Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e1501112c"}], "title": "BODIPY fluorescent chemosensor for Cu", "keywords": ["BODIPY", "Fluorescent chemosensor"], "venue": "Journal of Fluorescence", "year": 2014, "abstract": "Copper is an essential trace element for the proper functioning of organ and metabolic process in humans.

The result shows that the average grey level of fluorescence image at 365 nm increases obviously with the changes in the concentration of glucose; however, the average grey changes little at 353, 369 and 405 nm. This shows that the main effect of serum glucose on the fluorescence intensity peak appears at 365 nm. Because the fluorescence intensity has something to do with the concentration of the fluorescence material, the blood glucose concentration influences directly the fluorescence intensity at 365 nm. Therefore, it is possible to judge blood sugar content, and to make sure whether the content exceeds the normal value or not by comparing the fluorescence intensity of the blood serum measured at 365 nm.

Methods: Thirty-six patients with primary and secondary liver cancers (21 with primary hepatocellular carcinoma, 12 with colorectal cancer liver metastases and 3 with other malignant liver metastases), which were considered not suitable for curative resection, were include in this study. They were treated either with RFA (RITA2000, Mountain View, California, USA) percutaneously (n=20) or intraoperatively (n=16). The procedures were performed using the ultrasound guidance. The quality of RFA were based on monitoring of equipments and subject feeling of the practitioners. Patients treated with RFA was followed according to clinical findings, radiographic images, and tumor markers. Results: Thirty-six patients underwent RFA for 48 nodules. RFA was used to treat an average 1.3 lesions per patient, and the median size of treated lesions was 2.5 cm (range, 0.5-9 cm). The average hospital stay was 5.6 days overall (2.8 days for percutaneous cases and 7.9 days for open operations). Seven patients underwent a second RFA procedure (sequential ablations). Sixteen HCC patients with a high level of alpha fetoprotein (AFP) and 9 colorectal cancer liver metastases patients with a high level of serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) have a great reduction benefited from RFA. Four (11.1 %) patients had complications: one skin burn; one postoperative hemorrhage; one cholecystitis and one hepatic abscess associated with percutaneous ablations of a large lesion.

Several studies have reported the benefits of testosterone in heart failure. However, the mechanisms of testosterone-induced effects on heart failure require further study. Aims: To determine the effects of castration and testosterone administration on cardiac function and angiotensin II receptor function in rats with isoproterenol-induced heart failure. Methods: Wistar rats were divided randomly into control and heart failure groups. The heart failure groups were further divided into the following groups: castration; castration + testosterone replacement; and sham castration. Echocardiography and haemodynamic measurements were used to evaluate cardiac function. Cardiocyte apoptosis and fibrosis were determined using terminal deoxyribonucleotide transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labelling (TUNEL) staining and Masson's Trichrome staining, respectively. Angiotensin II receptor (AT1 and AT2) messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression levels were assayed using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactions, while Western immunoblotting was used to estimate Bcl-2 protein expression levels. Results: Castration significantly increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis and fibrosis that was normally induced by isoproterenol (P < 0.05). AT2 receptor mRNA expression in the castration group was increased and Bcl-2 protein expression was decreased compared with the castration + testosterone replacement group (P < 0.05). Conclusion: These data suggest that androgen therapy could play an important role in pathophysiological changes in heart failure and have beneficial effects for its treatment. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The objective of this study was to discuss the characteristics of lower limb vascular angiopathy and plaque formation in type 2 diabetes patients and finding its relevance to the carotid atherosclerotic plaque formation, thus directing the clinical diagnosis and treatment. Methods: The ultrasonography was used to monitor the patients with carotid artery and lower limb artery. Results: Compared with the control group, decreased blood flow to lower limb and lower limb angiopathy occurred more obviously in dorsal artery of foot than in popliteal artery. The study revealed that the detection rate of the prevalence of carotid atherosclerosis plaque and lower limb arterial plaque and the combination of plaque both carotid and lower limb arteries in diabetic patients was 369:342:296 (about 1.25:1.15:1) and that the prevalence of carotid plaque and lower limb arterial plaque in all subjects with plaque was 71.3%. The risk of plaque formation also had positive correlation with patient's age. Color Doppler ultrasound had a clinical significance in the early diagnosis and curative effect observation in type 2 diabetes with lower limb angiopathy. The risk of simultaneous plaque formation in both carotid artery and lower extremity artery was greater in type 2 diabetes than that of control subjects, but they were not necessarily to occur simultaneously.

Based on an expressed sequence tag named imds-60, which was first found in uterus but is highly expressed in epididymis, the full-length cDNA sequence of imds-60 with a complete open reading frame was obtained in mouse epididymis by GenBank searching, polymerase chain reaction-based procedures, and 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-rapid amplification of cDNA ends. This protein was predicted to have an N-terminal signal peptide and a C-terminal DNase I-like domain with nine transmembrane motifs in the middle part of the protein. Northern blot analysis showed that the mRNA of imds-60 was highly expressed in epididymis but at a rather lower level in uterus, seminal vesicle gland, and stomach. Further study revealed that the mRNA of imds-60 is only expressed in corpus and cauda regions of epididymis, not in caput. It is regulated partially by androgen and peaked in male mice aged from 3 weeks to adult. The imds-60 protein might play an important role in cell communication during sperm maturation. \u00a9 2007 Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, SIBS, CAS.", "pid": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150b87c1"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Yuchuan Zhou", "org": "Shanghai Key Laboratory for Molecular Biology", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f9dda7"}, {"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "Shanghai Key Laboratory for Molecular Biology", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f6de93"}, {"name": "Qixian Shi", "org": "Unit of Reproductive Physiology", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f9fa27"}, {"name": "Li Zhang", "org": "Shanghai Key Laboratory for Molecular Biology", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150a17b9"}, {"name": "Wei Zhen", "org": "Shanghai Key Laboratory for Molecular Biology", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e150572bd"}, {"name": "Wenying Chen", "org": "Unit of Reproductive Physiology", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150ef856"}, {"name": "Yonglian Zhang", "org": "Shanghai Institute of Planned Parenthood Research", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1506f6a0"}], "title": "An epididymis-specific secretory protein hongrES1 critically regulates sperm capacitation and male fertility", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "year": 2008, "abstract": "Mammalian sperm capacitation is an essential prerequisite to fertilizion.

Previously, we isolated and cloned the HongrES1 gene from rat cauda epididymis and found that it was exclusively expressed there. Here we report that HongrES1 mRNA is also expressed in the guinea pig cauda epididymis using Northern blot analysis, and the molecular weight of its cognate protein is approximately 48 kDa by Western blot analysis. Therefore, we investigated whether HongrES1 was involved in regulation of sperm capacitation in guinea pig. The results show that HongrES1 antisera (HA) significantly enhances sperm capacitation with maximal stimulation at a dilution of 1:500. Capacitation was reversed when capacitated spermatozoa were re-exposed to HongrES1 protein (HP, 0.25 \u03bcg/ml). In other words, HP acted as a decapacitation factor. HA accelerated the onset of capacitation and promoted a sperm hyperactivated motility response. Sperm capacitation was accelerated by HA stimulation of extracellular calcium influx while HP prevented extracellular calcium from influxing. Indirect immunofluorescence staining finds HP localized over the acrosomal anterior region of the sperm head, which exfoliates gradually during capacitation incubation, and completely disappeared after the acrosome reaction. Thus, HongrES1 expressed by the cauda epididymis is a novel molecule that regulates the physiology of guinea pig sperm prior to fertilization. \u00a9 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.", "pid": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1517692a"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "Coll. of Chem. and Chem.

Main outcome measures: 1 Growth of MSCs, 2 detection of labeling rate of DAPI on MSCs, 3 analysis of activity and purity of co-cultured myocardial cells, and 4 differentiation of MSCs into myocardial cells after co-culture. Results: 1 Bone marrow cell suspension was inoculated in plastic petri dish. Round cells scattered at the bottom of bottle. At hour 24 a few long fusiform shape adhered cells appeared following liquor change, and at day 4 many fusiform shape adhered cells appeared, which entered logarithm increased period. At days 8-12 80% were confluence. The proliferation of passage cells was more rapid. With liquor change and passage, the MSCs were purified gradually. 2 Labeling rate of DAPI on MSCs was 100%. 3 At 3-day in vitro culture of myocardial cells the percentage of beat cells was 63%, with beat frequency of 40-60 times per minute. Percentage of positive cells of troponin T expression was 75% examined with immunocytochemical technique. 4 At co-cultured days 2 and 3, positive percentage of DAPI labeled MSCs expressing MHC \u03b1/ \u03b2 was significantly higher in the SCF group than in the blank control group (P < 0.01). At the co-cultured days 3, 4 and 5, positive percentage of DAPI labeled MSCs expressing troponin T was obviously higher in the SCF group than in the blank control group (P < 0.01).

Methods: The concentration of GABA in experimental-side hippocampus at 90 min after the establishment of LTP induced by tetanic electrical stimulation (TS) was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection. Effects of microinjection of GABA and GABAA antagonist bicuculline methbromide(BMB) on LTP were observed. ResultsCircled digit one Compared with control group, the content of GABA in hippocampal tissues of LTP-induction rats obviously decreased (P < 0.01), and the concentration of glutamate showed no statistical difference.

Cerebral hypoperfusion for 30 days by occlusion of bilateral common carotid arteries induced marked amnesic effects along with neuron damage, including: (1) spatial learning and memory deficits shown by longer escape latency and shorter time spent in the target quadrant; (2) significant neuronal loss and nuclei condensation in the cortex and hippocampus especially in CA1 region; (3) lower induction rate of long term potentiation, overexpression of BAX and P53 protein, and lower content of excitatory and inhibitory amino acids in hippocampus.

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 is an inflammatory mediator produced during ischemia that may affect the survival of MSCs. In this study, we investigated the enhancement of MSC survival by transfecting cells with the TNF receptor (TNFR) gene, leading to the overproduction of TNFR and the binding of TNF-\u03b1. Rats with acute myocardial infarction, induced by the occlusion of the left coronary artery, were transplanted with MSC or MSC-TNFR.

We investigated whether cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibition in the PVN attenuates the activities of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in rats with adriamycin-induced heart failure. Methodology/Principal Finding: Heart failure was induced by intraperitoneal injection of adriamycin over a period of 2 weeks (cumulative dose of 15 mg/kg). On day 19, rats received intragastric administration daily with either COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib (CLB) or normal saline. Treatment with CLB reduced mortality and attenuated both myocardial atrophy and pulmonary congestion in HF rats. Compared with the HF rats, ventricle to body weight (VW/BW) and lung to body weight (LW/BW) ratios, heart rate (HR), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), left ventricular peak systolic pressure (LVPSP) and maximum rate of change in left ventricular pressure (LV\u00b1dp/dtmax) were improved in HF+CLB rats. Angiotensin II (ANG II), norepinephrine (NE), COX-2 and glutamate (Glu) in the PVN were increased in HF rats. HF rats had higher levels of ANG II and NE in plasma, higher level of ANG II in myocardium, and lower levels of ANP in plasma and myocardium. Treatment with CLB attenuated these HF-induced changes. HF rats had more COX-2-positive neurons and more corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) positive neurons in the PVN than did control rats. Treatment with CLB decreased COX-2-positive neurons and CRH positive neurons in the PVN of HF rats. Conclusions: These results suggest that PVN COX-2 may be an intermediary step for PVN neuronal activation and excitatory neurotransmitter release, which further contributes to sympathoexcitation and RAS activation in adriamycin-induced heart failure. Treatment with COX-2 inhibitor attenuates sympathoexcitation and RAS activation in adriamycin-induced heart failure. \u00a9 2012 Zheng et al.", "pid": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151f51f7"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Jie Shen", "org": "Res.

The results show that the FGCS can increase the temperature of top sintered bed, the waste heat utilization and the efficiency of flue gas desulfurization, make the distribution of solid temperature in direction of height more stable, and reduce the volume of flue gas to be treated and the load of desulfurization.", "pid": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e15085496"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Complex Nonferrous Metal Resources Clean Utilization, Kunming University of Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150d821b"}, {"name": "Lai-Hong Shen", "org": "Key Laboratory of Energy Thermal Conversion and Control of Ministry of Education, Southeast University", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fb44f6"}, {"name": "Xiao-Qiong Feng", "org": "Key Laboratory of Energy Thermal Conversion and Control of Ministry of Education, Southeast University", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ff92a6"}], "title": "Study on chemical-looping combustion of coal with CaSO4 oxygen carrier assisted by CaO addition", "keywords": ["CaO additive", "Chemical-looping combustion (CLC)", "Suppression of sulfur release"], "venue": "Ranliao Huaxue Xuebao/Journal of Fuel Chemistry and Technology", "year": 2014, "abstract": "The reactivity between the CaSO", "pid": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151ca84c"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Wenju Zhou", "org": "Shanghai Key Laboratory of Power Station Automation Technology, School of Mechatronics Engineering and Automation, Shanghai University", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1509aba0"}, {"name": "Minrui Fei", "org": "Shanghai Key Laboratory of Power Station Automation Technology, School of Mechatronics Engineering and Automation, Shanghai University", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1515b035"}, {"name": "Haikuan Wang", "org": "Shanghai Key Laboratory of Power Station Automation Technology, School of Mechatronics Engineering and Automation, Shanghai University", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fcd59b"}, {"name": "Gang Wang", "org": "School of Information and Electronic Engineering, Ludong University", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1507f4e6"}, {"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "Shanghai Key Laboratory of Power Station Automation Technology, School of Mechatronics Engineering and Automation, Shanghai University", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150d821b"}, {"name": "Kailong Liu", "org": "Shanghai Key Laboratory of Power Station Automation Technology, School of Mechatronics Engineering and Automation, Shanghai University", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1504fe07"}], "title": "Accurate camera image capture control based on iterative learning and Kalman filter", "keywords": ["Accurate positioning", "Camera control", "Iterative learning", "Kalman filter"], "venue": "Yi Qi Yi Biao Xue Bao/Chinese Journal of Scientific Instrument", "year": 2014, "abstract": "The moving targets in industrial high speed production line suffer from various disturbances; achieving accurate camera image capture control is a challenging task.

Methods: Laser treated porcine articular cartilage disks were maintained in culture media. The collected media at various time periods (3, 6, 9, 12, 24 and 48 h), was called treated conditioned media (TCM). Non-laser treated cartilage disks were used to create control conditioned media (CCM). Each disk was subsequently maintained for 28 days and used in confocal microscopic assessment to document the progression of the damaged area. Isolated porcine chondrocytes were cultured in monolayer, and were exposed to TCM, CCM or normal culture medium (NM). As a positive inducer of apoptosis, the monolayer cells were exposed to UV radiation for 10 min and cultured in NM. Following 24 h exposure, the cells were harvested and stained with the appropriate combination of fluorescent dyes and processed via flow cytometry. Results: All cultured cells exposed to TCM displayed a caspase-3 positive subpopulation, a loss of CMXRos, and with a reduced or lost NO signal. CCM exposure signals were comparable to the NM treatments with all having retained CMXRos, NO and without evidence of caspase-3 activity. UV treatment also induced a reduction in NO, but both CMXRos and caspase-3 positive, representing an earlier stage of apoptosis and suggesting that the mode of cell death via UV and TCM exposure are via different processes. The investigation of a dose (100%, 50%, 25% and 12.5%) and time (0. 5, 1, 3, 9, 12 h) response to TCM exhibited that all treatments observed an increase in caspase-3 positive cells and a reduction in NO and CMXRos.

Methods: One hundred cervical carcinoma patients underwent pretreatment serum CYFRA21-1 and SCCAg evaluation; 20 healthy women were subjected as control. The specificity and sensitivity of CYFRA21-1 and SCCAg as diagnostic indexes were analyzed; their correlations to clinicopathologic features were investigated through univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: The specificity of CYFRA21-1 and SCCAg in diagnosing cervical cancer were both 100%. The sensitivity of CYFRA21-1 and SCCAg in diagnosing cervical cancer were 36.0% and 47.0% respectively, without significant difference. The combined examination of CYFRA21-1 and SCCAg elevated the sensitivity to 60.0%, which was significantly higher than that of examining CYFRA21-1 alone. Univariate analysis showed elevation of CYFRA21-1 was related with FIGO stage and tumor size; elevation of SCCAg was related with pathologic type, tumor size, deep stromal invasion and pelvic node metastasis. Multivariate analysis showed that elevation of CYFRA21-1 had no relationship with any factors, while elevation of SCCAg was related with deep stromal invasion and pelvic node metastasis. The sensitivity of SCCAg in predicting pelvic node metastasis and deep stromal invasion were significantly higher than those of CYFRA21-1 (75.0% vs. 29.2%, p = 0.001; 55.8% vs. 26.9%, p = 0.024), and the addition of CYFRA21-1 to SCCAg could not significantly improve the sensitivity compared with SCCAg alone (79.2% vs. 75.0%, p > 0.05; 63.5% vs. 55.8%, p > 0.05). Conclusion: The value of pretreatment serum CYFRA21-1 as predictor of pelvic node metastasis and deep stromal invasion is less significant compared with that of SCCAg. For cervical squamous cell cancer, SCCAg is the preferred tumor marker. \u00a9 2009 Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center.", "pid": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f91b2d"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "Department of Gynecology, Cancer Center, Sun Yat-sen University", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1514790f"}, {"name": "Li Tang", "org": "Department of Gynecology, Cancer Center, Sun Yat-sen University", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f8844f"}, {"name": "Long Huang", "org": "Department of Gynecology, Cancer Center, Sun Yat-sen University", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e15050463"}, {"name": "Hui Ding", "org": "Department of Gynecology, Cancer Center, Sun Yat-sen University", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e15099106"}, {"name": "Wen-Ting Liao", "org": "Department of Gynecology, Cancer Center, Sun Yat-sen University", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e15066ced"}, {"name": "Mu-Sheng Zeng", "org": "Department of Gynecology, Cancer Center, Sun Yat-sen University", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fa6ac2"}, {"name": "Hui-Yun Wang", "org": "Department of Gynecology, Cancer Center, Sun Yat-sen University", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f82abb"}], "title": "Overexpression of karyopherin-2 in epithelial ovarian cancer and correlation with poor prognosis", "venue": "Obstetrics and Gynecology", "year": 2010, "abstract": "Objectives: To evaluate karyopherin 2 (KPNA2) as a biomarker for epithelial ovarian cancer. Methods: A candidate oncogene, KPNA2, was identified in gene microarray assays of epithelial ovarian cancer tissues compared with normal human ovarian surface epithelial tissues. Differences in expression were further validated by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. KPNA2 expression patterns in epithelial ovarian cancer tissues were determined using immunohistochemistry and were compared with specific clinicopathologic features of the patient specimens analyzed. Factors associated with patient survival were also statistically analyzed. Results: KPNA2 was found to be upregulated approximately eightfold in epithelial ovarian cancer tissues compared with human ovarian surface epithelial tissues, and overexpression was detected at the level of both transcription and translation. Immunohistochemical assays detected positive KPNA2 expression (++ or +++) in 50 of 102 (49.0%) epithelial ovarian cancer specimens, whereas negative KPNA2 expression (-or +) was observed in all of the human ovarian surface epithelial tissues analyzed. KPNA2 overexpression was also found to be significantly associated with specific histologic type, an advanced stage, a high histologic grade, and tumor recurrence (P<.05). The 5-year overall survival rate for KPNA2-negative compared with KPNA2-positive patients was 73.1% and 60.5%, respectively (P<.05). Conclusion: KPNA2 may play an important role in the development, differentiation, and carcinogenesis of epithelial ovarian cancer and therefore could be an indicator of poor prognosis for patients with epithelial ovarian cancer. \u00a9 2010 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

The prognosis of cervical cancer patients with common iliac lymph node metastasis is poor, but few systematic studies have been reported. This study was to investigate the characteristics, risk, treatment and prognosis of stage IB-IIB cervical carcinoma patients with common iliac lymph node metastasis. METHODS: A total of 960 patients with cervical cancer receiving radical hysterectomy and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy were selected from the hospitalized patients in the Cancer Center of Sun Yat-sen University between January 1995 and December 2005, and analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Of the 960 patients, 288 (30.0%) had pelvic lymph node metastasis, and 45 (4.7%) had positive common iliac lymph node. The 5-year overall survival rate (OS) of patients with common iliac lymph node metastasis was 46.1%, and 67.5% in patients with other pelvic lymph node metastasis (P < 0.05). Univariate analysis showed that clinical stage, serum level of squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC-Ag) > 4 microg/L before treatment, depth of cervical invasion > or =2/3 and positive parametrial margin were associated with common iliac lymph node metastasis (P < 0.05). Patients with > or =3 pelvic lymph node metastasis (excluding common iliac lymph node) or recurrence had poor prognosis (P < 0.05).

Methods and materials: Total RNA was prepared from 32 samples of early adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix and 32 paired normal cervix tissues, and hybridized to cancer-associated oligonucleotide microarrays with probe sets complementary to about 1,426 transcripts. Results: Supervised analysis of gene expression data identified 13 genes that exhibited >2-fold upregulation and 27 genes >2-fold downregulation, respectively, in early adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix compared to normal cervix. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the expression data readily distinguished early adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix from normal cervix. Two genes (karyopherin alpha 2 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen) were selected randomly for real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis. Both genes were expressed significantly higher in early adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix than in normal cervix, with p = 0.0003 and <0.0001, respectively. These results were compatible with the microarray data.

The objective of this study was to identify a gene-expression signature that could predict PLNM in cervical carcinoma. METHODS: Eighty-eight women with cervical carcinoma with PLNM (n = 23) and without PLNM (n = 65) were divided randomly into a training group and a test group. An oligonucleotide microarray that contained probes for 1440 human cancer-related genes was fabricated in-house and was used to detect the gene expression profile of cervical carcinoma. The gene expression levels detected in the microarray were verified by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). RESULTS: A gene-expression signature for predicting PLNM was developed in patients from the training group, including 11 genes: ribosomal protein L35 (RPL35); thymosin \u03b2 10 (TMSB10); tyrosine 3-mono-oxytenase/tryptophan 5-mono-oxygenase activation protein, \u00ce\u00b6 polypeptide (YWHAZ); biotinidase (BTD); lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA); glucuronidase \u03b2 (GUSB); superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2); nuclear receptor subfamily 3, group C, member 2 (NR3C2); fructosamine 3 kinase (FN3K); x-ray repair cross-complementing 4 (XRCC4); and wingless-type mouse mammary tumor virus integration site family member 2 (WNT2). In the test group, the signature's accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 91%, 90.9%, 93.9%, 83.3%, and 96.9%, respectively, for predicting PLNM. The expression levels of 5 genes in the signature were confirmed by qRT-PCR. A multivariate analysis demonstrated that patients with 11-gene high-risk scores were had a 33-fold increased risk for PLNM compared with patients who had low-risk scores. The 5-year overall and disease-free survival rates for patients who had 11-gene high-risk scores were marginally significantly lower than the rates for patients who had 11-gene low-risk scores (P =.087 and P =.174, respectively).

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been used as cancer-related biomarkers in a variety of tumor types, and the objective of this study was to determine whether microRNA expression profiles can predict clinical outcome in SCCC. Methodology/Principal Findings: Forty-four patients with SCCC who underwent radical hysterectomy between January 2000 and October 2009 were enrolled. Using the GeneCopoeia All-in-One\u2122 Customized Human qPCR Primer Array, the expression profiles of 30 miRNAs associated with tumor metastasis was obtained from the formalin-fixed paraffin embedded samples of all 44 patients. Seven miRNAs, has-let-7c, has-miR-10b, has-miR-100, has-miR-125b, has-miR-143, has-miR-145 and has-miR-199a-5p were significantly down-regulated in advanced stage SCCCpatients (FIGO IB2-IV) compared to early stage SCCC patients (FIGOIB1). Among, downregulation of six miRNAs, has-let-7c, has-miR-100, has-miR-125b, has-miR-143, has-miR-145 and has-miR-199a-5p were significantly associated with lymph node metastasis and reduced survival in SCCC. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses revealed that SCCC patients with low expression of has-miR-100 (P = 0.019) and has-miR-125b (P = 0.020) projected a significant tendency towards poorer prognosis. Conclusions/Significance: This study demonstrates that downregulation of 7 miRNA associated with advanced stage, 6 miRNAs with metastasis and 2 with poor prognosis in SCCC. Functional analysis of these miRNAs may enhance our understanding of SCCC, as altered expression of specific miRNAs may regulate the metastatic pathway and provide novel targets for therapy. \u00a9 2012 Huang et al.", "pid": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1513d839"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Li He", "org": "Department of Gynecology, Cancer Center", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fc9bc8"}, {"name": "Hui Ding", "org": "Department of Gynecology, Cancer Center", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e15099106"}, {"name": "Jian-Hua Wang", "org": "Department of Chest", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151e82e8"}, {"name": "Yun Zhou", "org": "Department of Gynecology, Cancer Center", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1513c0f6"}, {"name": "Li Li", "org": "Department of Gynecology", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e15109c31"}, {"name": "Yan-Hong Yu", "org": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fa6742"}, {"name": "Long Huang", "org": "Department of Gynecology, Cancer Center", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e15050463"}, {"name": "Wei-Hua Jia", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Oncology in Southern China, Cancer Center", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e151538be"}, {"name": "Musheng Zeng", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Oncology in Southern China, Cancer Center", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fa6ac2"}, {"name": "Jing-Ping Yun", "org": "Department of Pathology, Cancer Center", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f77084"}, {"name": "Rong-Zhen Luo", "org": "Department of Pathology, Cancer Center", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fab775"}, {"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "Department of Gynecology, Cancer Center", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1514790f"}], "title": "Overexpression of Karyopherin 2 in Human Ovarian Malignant Germ Cell Tumor Correlates with Poor Prognosis", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "year": 2012, "abstract": "Background: The aim of this study was to identify a biomarker useful in the diagnosis and therapy of ovarian malignant germ cell tumor (OMGCT).

Methods: Differences in the expression of GOLPH3 at the mRNA and protein level were examined via quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR and western blotting, respectively. GOLPH3 expression levels in ESCC tissue were determined through immunohistochemistry, and were compared in accordance with specific clinicopathological features of the patients and tissue specimens. Factors associated with patient survival were also analyzed. Results: A notably higher level of GOLPH3 expression was found in ESCC cell lines and tissues at both mRNA and protein levels. High expression of GOLPH3 in ESCC patients was positively associated with clinical stage, TNM classification, histological differentiation and vital status (all P<0.0001).

Conclusions: Experiments demonstrated potential involvement of GOLPH3 in the development, differentiation, and tumorigenesis of ESCC, and concludes the possibility of its use as a diagnostic and prognostic marker in patients with ESCC. \u00a9 2012 Wang et al.", "pid": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e150287d1"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Long Huang", "org": "Department of Pathology", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e15050463"}, {"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "Department of Pathology", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1514790f"}, {"name": "Qing-Ming Zhou", "org": "Department of Gynecology", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1502591c"}, {"name": "Mei-Yin Zhang", "org": "Department of Gynecology", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151f5065"}, {"name": "Yan-Hong Yu", "org": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fa6742"}, {"name": "Jing-Ping Yun", "org": "Department of Pathology", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e1520cc14"}, {"name": "Hui-Yun Wang", "org": "Department of Gynecology", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f82abb"}], "title": "Identification of a 7-gene signature that predicts relapse and survival for early stage patients with cervical carcinoma", "keywords": ["Cervical carcinoma", "Gene expression profiling", "Microarray", "Prognosis prediction"], "venue": "Medical Oncology", "year": 2012, "abstract": "There is no gene signature for predicting relapse and survival of cervical cancer with early stage currently. In this study, we investigate whether gene expression profiling of cervical cancer could be used to predict the prognosis of patient. A series of 100 primary cervical cancer patients who underwent radical hysterectomy between January 2001 and October 2006 were analyzed for gene expression profiles by using a custom oligonucleotide microarray containing probes for 1440 human tumor-related gene transcripts. Supervised analysis of gene expression data identified 19 genes that exhibited differential expression between cervical cancer and normal cervix. Then, all 100 patients were divided into the training (n = 50) and testing sets (n = 50). Using Cox regression and risk-score analysis, we identified a 7-gene (UBL3, FGF3, BMI1, PDGFRA, PTPRF, RFC4, and NOL7) signature for predicting relapse of patient in the training set. The 7-gene signature was validated by the testing set (sensitivity, 84.6%; specificity, 91.9%; positive predictive value, 78.6%; negative predictive value, 94.4%). Patients with high-risk 7-gene signature had poor relapse-free survivals (RFS) than patients with low-risk 7-gene signature in both training set (P = 0.026) and testing set (P = 0.042). Multivariate analysis showed that the FIGO stage and 7-gene signature are independent prognostic factors associated with RFS of cervical cancer patients. The 7-gene signature can predict cancer recurrence and survival of cervical cancer patients. This may have prognostic or therapeutic implications for the future management of cervical cancer patients. \u00a9 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.", "pid": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f9f35d"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Ying Xiong", "org": "Department of Gynecology", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151eda5b"}, {"name": "Ji-Hong Liu", "org": "Department of Gynecology", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fa9113"}, {"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "Department of Gynecology", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1514790f"}, {"name": "Li-Ping Cao", "org": "Department of Gynecology", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151a3389"}, {"name": "Li-Zhi Liang", "org": "Department of Gynecology", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e150204cd"}], "title": "Use of preoperative clinicopathologic characteristics to identify patients with low-risk cervical cancer suitable for Piver class II radical hysterectomy", "keywords": ["Cervical cancer", "Radical hysterectomy", "Recurrence", "Risk stratification", "Survival", "Tumor size"], "venue": "International Journal of Gynecology and Obstetrics", "year": 2013, "abstract": "Objective To investigate the long-term efficacy of Piver-Rutledge class II radical hysterectomy (Piver II RH) for treatment of early-stage cervical cancer and to identify suitable candidates for this procedure. Methods A retrospective study was conducted of 432 cervical cancer patients (tumor size \u2264 4 cm) treated with Piver II RH at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China, between January 1, 1999, and June 30, 2005. The correlation of preoperative and postoperative characteristics with recurrence and survival was analyzed. Results Median follow-up was 72 months; the overall recurrence rate was 14.6%. The 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) was 88.0% and the 5-year overall survival (OS) was 93.0%. Significant differences were observed between patients with small (\u2264 2 cm) and large (> 2 cm) tumors with regard to intra-pelvic recurrence (2.5% vs 13.4%; P = 0.001), extra-pelvic recurrence (3.4% vs 9.9%; P = 0.028), RFS (95.0% vs 86.0%; P = 0.005), and OS (95.0% vs 87.0%; P = 0.005).

Methods and materials: Seventy-two consecutive ESS cases treated between 1995 and 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. Results: Sixty-three patients received surgical treatment. Forty-one patients underwent pelvic lymphadenectomy. In paraffin-embedded specimens, expression of the following molecular markers was detected: CD10 (27/36), vimentin (37/38), HHF35 (3/32), S-100 (0/25), desmin (2/29), CD117 (0/23), CD34 (2/24), alpha-inhibin (0/17), CK (1/34), CD99 (4/9), smooth muscle actin (5/25), EMA (0/7), estrogen receptor (13/16) and progesterone receptor (13/16). CD10 and vimentin were expressed more frequently in these specimens. Tumor classification, CD10 and surgical procedures were significantly associated with disease-free survival (DFS). Surgical procedures were significantly associated with overall survival (OS). Tumor stage (P = 0.024) and surgical procedure (P = 0.042) were found to be significant independent prognostic factors for DFS. No complete or partial response was observed among patients who received radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Conclusions: Our results indicate that total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo- oophorectomy followed by pelvic lymphadenectomy is associated with an improved treatment outcome. CD10-negative expression may contribute to the malignant characteristics and recurrence associated with ESS. \u00a9 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.", "pid": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1513a44f"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Long Huang", "org": "Department of Oncology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e15050463"}, {"name": "Ling-Min Liao", "org": "Department of Ultrasound, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150cfdcc"}, {"name": "An-Wen Liu", "org": "Department of Oncology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151f16ee"}, {"name": "Jian-Bing Wu", "org": "Department of Oncology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e15149660"}, {"name": "Xiao-Ling Cheng", "org": "Department of Medical Imaging, Women And Children Health Institute Futian", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150c1629"}, {"name": "Jia-Xin Lin", "org": "Department of Gynecology, Cancer Center, Sun Yat-sen University", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15fff901"}, {"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "Department of Gynecology, Cancer Center, Sun Yat-sen University", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1514790f"}], "title": "Analysis of the impact of platinum-based combination chemotherapy in small cell cervical carcinoma: A multicenter retrospective study in Chinese patients", "keywords": ["Cervical cancer", "Platinum-based combination chemotherapy", "Prognosis", "Small cell carcinoma"], "venue": "BMC Cancer", "year": 2014, "abstract": "Background: Small cell cervical carcinoma (SCCC) is a rare, aggressive tumor with a poor prognosis. However, information in relation to its treatment is scarce due to the limited numbers of patients. The aim of this study was to establish whether platinum-based combination chemotherapy may by beneficial in this patient population.Methods: We carried out a multicenter, retrospective study comprising of 72 Chinese patients with SCCC. The patients were treated between 1995 and 2010 at Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital or the Cancer Center of Sun Yat-Sen University, and at the First Affiliated Hospital of Shantou University Medical College, China.Results: Of the 72 patients, 46/72 (63.9%) had Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage Ia-Ib2 and 26/72 (36.1%) had stage IIa-IV disease. Surgery was performed in 63/72 (87.5%) patients, 61/72 (84.7%) patients received chemoradiotherapy and 35/72 (48.6%) received radiotherapy. The 3-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates were as follows: Ia (100%, 100%); Ib1 (62%, 57%); Ib2 (53%, 48%); IIa (36%, 23%); IIb (29%, 21%); IIIb (50%, 50%); and IV (0%, 0%), respectively. The estimated 3-year OS and DFS rates in patients who received platinum-based combination chemotherapy (etoposide + cisplatin [EP], or paclitaxel + cisplatin [TP]) as part of their adjuvant treatment were 64.8% and 63.0%, respectively, compared to 25.2% and 22.0% in those who did not (P = 0.0003; P = 0.0003). Univariate analysis showed that platinum-based combination chemotherapy was associated with improved survival compared to other chemotherapy techniques or no chemotherapy (OS: HR = 0.227; 95% CI, 0.099-0.524; P = 0.001; DFS: HR = 0.210; 95% CI, 0.087-0.506; P = 0.001). Multivariate analysis identified FIGO stage, lymphatic metastasis and platinum-based combination chemotherapy as independent prognostic factors for improved survival in patients with SCCC.Conclusions: Platinum-based combination chemotherapy (with EP or TP) can improve the 3-year survival outcomes in patients with SCCC. Therefore, it should be considered an important component in a future standardized treatment strategy for SCCC. \u00a9 2014 Huang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "pid": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f4af2d"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Ling-Min Liao", "org": "Department of Ultrasound, Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150cfdcc"}, {"name": "Xiao-Ying Sun", "org": "Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Central Hospital Attached to Shenyang Medical College", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f5fc6a"}, {"name": "An-Wen Liu", "org": "Department of Oncology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151f16ee"}, {"name": "Jian-Bing Wu", "org": "Department of Oncology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e150763d4"}, {"name": "Xiao-Ling Cheng", "org": "Department of Medical Imaging, Women and Children Health Institute Futian", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150c1629"}, {"name": "Jia-Xin Lin", "org": "Department of Gynecology, Cancer Center, Sun Yat-sen University", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15fff901"}, {"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "Department of Gynecology, Cancer Center, Sun Yat-sen University", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1514790f"}, {"name": "Long Huang", "org": "Department of Oncology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e15050463"}], "title": "Low expression of long noncoding XLOC-010588 indicates a poor prognosis and promotes proliferation through upregulation of c-Myc in cervical cancer", "keywords": ["c-Myc", "Cervical cancer", "Long noncoding RNA", "XLOC-010588"], "venue": "Gynecologic Oncology", "year": 2014, "abstract": "Objective The identification and investigation of cancer-associated long non-coding RNAs are important for understanding the molecular biology of cancer. The aim of the present study was to examine the expression pattern of lncRNA XLOC-010588 in cervical cancer and to evaluate its biological role and clinical significance in tumor progression. Methods We examined the expression of XLOC-010588 in 218 cervical cancer tissues and matched 218 adjacent normal tissues using real-time qRT-PCR. Over-expression and RNA interference approaches were used to investigate the biological functions of XLOC-010588. The effect of XLOC-010588 on proliferation was evaluated by MTT and BrdU assays. Western blot assays were used to investigate the molecular mechanism by which XLOC-010588 increases cervical cancer cell proliferation. Results The results showed that XLOC-010588 expression in cervical cancer was significantly downregulated. Decreased XLOC-010588 expression was correlated with FIGO stage, tumor size and SCC-Ag. Moreover, cervical cancer patients with XLOC-010588 lower expression have shown poorer prognosis. Multivariate Cox regression analyses showed that XLOC-010588 expression served as an independent predictor for overall survival. Ectopic expression of XLOC-010588 inhibited the proliferation of HeLa and SiHa cells. By contrast, knockdown of XLOC-010588 promoted the growth of HCC94 cells. Western blot assays confirmed that XLOC-010588 physically associates with c-Myc, consequently decreasing the expression of c-Myc. The expression of XLOC-010588 and c-Myc is strongly correlated in cervical cancer tissues. Conclusion These results suggested that XLOC-010588 plays a pivotal role in cervical cancer cell proliferation via decreasing c-Myc expression and implicated the potential application of XLOC-010588 in cervical cancer therapy. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc.", "pid": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151e30df"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Long Huang", "org": "Department of Oncology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e15050463"}, {"name": "Ling-Min Liao", "org": "Department of Ultrasound, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150cfdcc"}, {"name": "An-Wen Liu", "org": "Department of Oncology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151f16ee"}, {"name": "Jian-Bing Wu", "org": "Department of Oncology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e150763d4"}, {"name": "Xiao-Ling Cheng", "org": "Department of Medical Imaging, Women and Children Health Institute Futian", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150c1629"}, {"name": "Jia-Xin Lin", "org": "Department of Gynecology, Cancer Center, Sun Yat-sen University", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15fff901"}, {"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "Department of Gynecology, Cancer Center, Sun Yat-sen University", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1514790f"}], "title": "Overexpression of long noncoding RNA HOTAIR predicts a poor prognosis in patients with cervical cancer", "keywords": ["Cervical cancer", "HOTAIR", "Long noncoding RNA", "Prognosis"], "venue": "Archives of Gynecology and Obstetrics", "year": 2014, "abstract": "Purpose: The long noncoding RNA HOTAIR has been reported to be a good biomarker for poor prognosis in a variety of human cancers.

Results showed that source-separated grey water had low concentrations of pollutants, which helped the reuse of grey water. However, the system had a low separation efficiency between the yellow water and the brown water, which was caused by the plug problem in the urine collection from the urine-diverting toilets. During the storage of yellow water for liquid fertilizer production, nearly all urea nitrogen transferred to ammonium nitrogen and about 2/3 phosphorus was lost because of the struvite precipitation. Total bacteria and coliforms increased first in the storage, but then decreased to low concentrations. The anaerobic/anoxic/aerobic MBR had high elimination rates of COD, ammonium nitrogen and total nitrogen of the brown water, which were 94.2%, 98.1% and 95.1%, respectively. However, the effluent still had high contents of colority, nitrate and phosphorus, which affected the application of the effluent for flushing water. Even though, the effluent might be used as dilution water for the yellow water fertilizer. Based on the results and the assumption of an ideal operation of the vacuum source-separation system, a future plan for on-site eco-sewerage system of modern office buildings was constructed. Its sustainability was validated by the analysis of the substances flow of water and nutrients. \u00a9 2010 American Institute of Physics.", "pid": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f7bafd"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "Dept. of Comp.

The model can describe simultaneous storage, utilization of storage product, and growth of heterotrophic bacteria. The parameter calibration procedures were conducted in groups of batch tests that represent different MBR system configurations, including pre- and post-denitrification. A high agreement between actual measurement and model simulation for enhanced denitrification was obtained in a full-scale MBR system.

High microbial storage yields were essential in increasing the denitrification rate, which mainly contributed the enhanced denitrification capacity in pre-denitrification.

Guizhou Province (at N24\u00b0 30\u2032-29\u00b0 13\u2032, E103\u00b0 1\u2032-109\u00b0 30\u2032, 1 100 m above the sea level, with subtropical humid climate) in southwest China is an important mercury production center. It has been found that the mercury content in most media of aquatics, soil, atmosphere and in biomass of corns, plants and animals, is higher than the national standard. The present study aims to explore the influence of mercury pollution on the health of local citizens. Methods: The effect of rice from two mercury polluted experimental plots of Guizhou Province on the expression of c-jun mRNA in rat brain and c-jun protein in cortex, hippocampus and ependyma was observed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunocytochemical methods. Results: The results showed that the mercury polluted rice induced expression of c-jun mRNA and its protein significantly. Selenium can reduce Hg uptake, an antagonism between selenium and mercury on the expression of c-jun mRNA and c-jun protein. Conclusion: c-jun participates in the toxicity process of brain injury by mercury polluted rice, the expression of c-jun mRNA in brain, and c-jun protein in rat cortex and hippocampus can predict neurotoxicity of mercury polluted rice. People should be advised to be cautious in eating any kind of Hg-polluted foods. To reveal the relationship between c-jun induction and apoptosis, further examinations are required.

nanocomposite was successfully synthesized by a simple mechanical method, without adding any surfactants. TEM images showed that CuS existed in the nanocomposite and the size of CuS/ZnO nanocomposite particle was around 35 nm. CuS worked as an electron absorber in the nanocomposite, which was beneficial for the improvement of photocatalysis of ZnO. It was also proved by the experiments performed under the visible light irradiation that CuS could help ZnO degrade methylene blue (MB). The catalytic efficiency of the nanocomposites reached the highest value when 0.5 wt% CuS was added. In addition, compared with pure ZnO, the CuS/ZnO nanocomposite exhibited a better photochemical stability up to 5 catalytic cycles. More importantly, CuS did not reduce the antibacterial property of ZnO. All these results indicated that as-prepared samples had some potential values in practical applications. \u00a9 2014 Lianping Zhu et al.", "pid": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f4ad2a"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "College of Textile and Clothing Engineering, Soochow University", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f599e8"}, {"name": "Zhi-Xiang Wu", "org": "College of Textile and Clothing Engineering, Soochow University", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151c1781"}, {"name": "Hong-Rong Lu", "org": "College of Textile and Clothing Engineering, Soochow University", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151f5355"}, {"name": "Jia-Jing Wei", "org": "College of Textile and Clothing Engineering, Soochow University", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151c6c27"}], "title": "Coloration and functional finishing of silk fabric using self-prepared inorganic microcrystals dispersoid nano-super (R)", "keywords": ["Anti-ultraviolet", "Coloration", "Flame retardance", "Nanomaterial", "Silk"], "venue": "Proceedings of the Fiber Society 2009 Spring Conference", "year": 2009, "abstract": "To overcome the problems of existing silk textile coloration methods, we developed a kind of method to prepare inorganic microcrystals dispersoid nano-super(R) agent with well-dispersed property.

Most malignant renal tumors had the same enhancement pattern with respect to the surrounding normal tissues. Most benign renal tumors wash in at the same time but wash out slowly comparing with surrounding normal tissues.

It is shown that speculative behaviour of chartists can cause the market price to display different forms of equilibrium distributions. In particular, when chartists are less active, there is a unique equilibrium distribution which is stable. However, when the chartists become more active, a new equilibrium distribution will be generated and become stable. The corresponding stationary density will change from a single peak to a crater-like density. The change of stationary distribution is characterized by a bimodal logarithm price distribution and fat tails.

Because of the complexity of the interaction between the nonlinearities and noise, a commonly used, often called indirect, approach to the study of HAMs combines theoretical analysis of the underlying deterministic skeleton with numerical analysis of the stochastic model. However, it is well known that this indirect approach may not properly characterise the nature of the stochastic model. This paper aims to tackle this issue by developing a direct and analytical approach to the analysis of a stochastic model of speculative price dynamics involving two types of agents, fundamentalists and chartists, and the market price equilibria of which can be characterised by the stationary measures of a stochastic dynamical system. Using the stochastic method of averaging and stochastic bifurcation theory, we show that the stochastic model displays behaviour consistent with that of the underlying deterministic model when the time lag in the formation of price trends used by the chartists is far away from zero. However, when this lag approaches zero, such consistency breaks down. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier B.V.", "pid": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fa4e00"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Xue-Zhong He", "org": "School of Finance and Economics", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151bbc6c"}, {"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "China Institute for Actuarial Science", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f517bd"}], "title": "Dynamics of moving average rules in a continuous-time financial market model", "keywords": ["Asset price", "Bifurcations", "Financial market behavior", "Heterogeneous beliefs", "Stability", "Stochastic delay differential equations", "Stylized facts"], "venue": "Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization", "year": 2010, "abstract": "Within a continuous-time framework, this paper proposes a stochastic heterogeneous agent model (HAM) of financial markets with time delays to unify various moving average rules used in discrete-time HAMs. The time delay represents a memory length of a moving average rule in discrete-time HAMs. Intuitive conditions for the stability of the fundamental price of the deterministic model in terms of agents' behavior parameters and memory length are obtained.

Within this framework, the different roles of the macroeconomic factor and investor heterogeneity in the determination of the exchange rate are examined explicitly.

Controlled by the Cenozoic intracontinental orogeny in area of the Tianshan Mountains, the Wushi Sag created with the same basin-forming dynamics of the Kuqa Depression. In Wushi, the Cenozoic deformation had different features from the Kuqa Depression, because there was the Wensu Rise, to the south of the Wushi Sag, which resisted southward expanding of the compressional stress, and a NW-striking structural transfer belt (the West Qiultag structural belt) separated the Wushi Sag from the Kuqa Depression. The Meso-Cenozoic strata in the Wushi Sag could be divided, by the gypsum-salt bed in the Miocene Jidike Formation, into two structural layers. Generally speaking, the deformation in the upper structural layer was characterized with back-thrust, and a basement-evolved ramp thrust occurred in the lower structural layer. In addition, a thrust in the Pre-Mesozoic basement should be emphasized, since the Wensu Rise acted once a provenance to the Wushi Sag during Meso-Cenozoic. These deformation features in Wushi might be related to westward migration of the Cenozoic compressional stress, and some thrust deformation absorbed by the strike-slipping along the northern and southern boundaries of the Wushi Sag, which indicated an inheritance of Cenozoic structures to the Hercynian-Indosinian collisional tectonics in the Chinese South Tianshan.

Based on what mentioned, the paper explored the basin-formation dynamics, analysed the coupled evolution between the Wushi Sag and the South Tianshan orogen, and pointed out that the main target for the oil-gas exploration in Wushi should be Triassic Huangshanjie Formation.", "pid": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e15182fb4"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Yuejun Li", "org": "Institute of Geology and Geophysics", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151e9bbd"}, {"name": "Genyao Wu", "org": "Institute of Geology and Geophysics", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151a0d83"}, {"name": "Qinglong Meng", "org": "Institute of Geology and Geophysics", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150cd747"}, {"name": "Jun Shi", "org": "Tarim Oilfield Branch Company", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150c0057"}, {"name": "Xiaojun Feng", "org": "Tarim Oilfield Branch Company", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e15174444"}, {"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "Lanzhou Oil-Gas Resource Centre", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1506e64c"}], "title": "Active modes and mechanisms of the Paleozoic faultings in western Tarim", "keywords": ["Basin-orogeny coupling", "Early Caledonian thrusting", "Hercynian normal faulting", "Paleozoic", "The Badong fracture", "The Madong fault zone", "Western Tarim"], "venue": "Scientia Geologica Sinica", "year": 2008, "abstract": "Based on systematic interpretation of seismic profiles and a comparative study to central area of the Tarim Basin, the active modes and mechanisms of the Paleozoic faultings in western Tarim were explored in the paper. The NE-striking Madong (Badongnan) fault zone, as a part of southeastern boundary of the Bachu Fault-Uplift, was a superficial d\u00e9collement fold-and-thrust belt, and expanded southeastwards. The piggy-back thrusting occurred in the end of Ordovician. The NW-striking Badong fracture (or the No. 2 Tumxuk fracture), the eastern boundary of the Bachu Fault-Uplift, was a basement-involved thrust, with the thrusting occurring in the ends of Ordovician and Middle Permian respectively. The Baxi and South of Well Tacan 2 fractures in north part of the Markit Slope were Hercynian normal faults. The Paleozoic development of the Tarim paleo-plate was constrained by the neighbouring orogenic evolution. The thrusting of nearly W-E and NE-striking fractures in early Caledonian, related to subduction of the West Kunlun ocean, might inherit the basement structures. The NW-striking fractures in central Tarim was neogenic in Late Cambrian, in which two episodes of Caledonian deformation could be recognized: the early thrusting in the end of Ordovician and late thrusting and strike-slipping during Late Silurian to Middle Devonian. The later deformation should be resulted from the activation of the Paleo-Altun shearing orogen, so as to obviously become weeker westwards. Some NW-striking fractures in west Tarim, for example, the Kangxi fracture, attached to the Tazhong(central Tarim) NW-striking fracture system. The NE-striking Madong fault zone was a transfer fault between the Tumxuk fault zone (thrusting towards the north to east) and the Wells Tazhong 8-1 and Tazhong 5 fault zone (thrusting towards the south to east).", "pid": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e15066bfd"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "Lanzhou Oil and Gas Resources Center, Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1506e64c"}, {"name": "Zifang Meng", "org": "Lanzhou Oil and Gas Resources Center, Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150f1fe2"}, {"name": "Shenchao Luo", "org": "Tarim Oilfield Corporation, PetroChina", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1506ced8"}, {"name": "Xiaojun Feng", "org": "Tarim Oilfield Corporation, PetroChina", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e15174444"}, {"name": "Bing Jing", "org": "Tarim Oilfield Corporation, PetroChina", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151a189b"}, {"name": "Yong Li", "org": "Tarim Oilfield Corporation, PetroChina", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e1500280a"}, {"name": "Yuejun Li", "org": "Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151e9bbd"}], "title": "Tectonic evolution series of the Niaoshan structure belt in the Bachu uplift, Tarim Basin, and its significance in hydrocarbon exploration", "keywords": ["Bachu uplift", "Balanced section", "Mazhatage structure", "Niaoshan structure", "Tectonic evolution series"], "venue": "Acta Geologica Sinica", "year": 2009, "abstract": "Niaoshan structure belt, located at the junctional zone between the southwest Depression of Tarim Basin, and Bachu Uplift, and to the western margin of the Hetianhe gas field, is an important structure unit within the Tarim Basin.

Taking the relationship between tectonic evolution and oil-cracking gas accumulation of late stage for the Shunan area in the Sichuan Basin as an example, through the analysis on the responds of structural evolution to deposition, the relationship between hydrocarbon generation process of ancient source rocks, initial hydrocarbon accumulation, oil cracking and gas accumulation of late stage was studied. The source rocks of the Cambrian Qiongzhusi Formation in the Shunan area experienced three periods of hydrocarbon generation and two lag periods of hydrocarbon generation. During the large-scale tectonic uplift and thick erosion event in the periods of the Caledonian and the Hercynian, source rocks of the Qiongzhusi Formation had experienced two periods of hydrocarbon generation and two lag periods of hydrocarbon generation. The overlying super-thick strata deposited during the Indosinian and Yanshan periods made the source rocks of the Qiongzhusi Formation continuously generate oil and gas. The crude oil in the paleo-reservoir of the Longwangmiao Formation experienced one time of oil-cracking gas process. After the Indo-Chinese Epoch, the burial depth of the Triassic was deep enough to promote the crude oil in the paleo-reservoir of the Longwangmiao Formation to crack into gas.

Their formation conditions and characteristics are shown as following: 1) high organic matter abundance, different types of resources caused by organic matter type and thermal evolution degree; 2) organic-matter rich sections distributed continuously in the reservoir space dominated by nanometer organic pore, intergranular pore and micro fracture; 3) hydrocarbon occurrence dominated by free and adsorption mode with quite different resource types; 4) self-conserved with conservation conditions controlled by tectonics, temperature and pressure, enriched in depression and slope areas; 5) Improvement of well production through creating \u201cartificial permeability\u201d based on volume fracturing method. Separated source-reservoir type is special, mainly including: 1) oil sand, heavy oil and other conventional resources after transformation; 2) unsteady resources formed under special temperature and pressure conditions, represented by natural gas hydrates. The development prospects of these three types are different from the reality as below: 1) Adjacent source-reservoir type is most available, which will develop rapidly in the next five years; 2) United source-reservoir type needs continuous exploration and technical research, expected to rapidly develop in the coming decade; 3) Separated source-reservoir type is represented by natural gas hydrates with the most promising development potential, and relevant technical test is being carried out.", "pid": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151ac36f"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Huan-Hai Fang", "org": "Xuzhou Normal University", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150de630"}, {"name": "Rong-Ping Zhang", "org": "Foreign Languages Department", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15014735"}, {"name": "Huan-Fei Fang", "org": "Center for the Study of Language and Cognition", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151a6bb6"}, {"name": "Ming-Yang Gao", "org": "Xuzhou Normal University", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1505deff"}, {"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "Xuzhou Normal University", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15009f9c"}, {"name": "Xiao-Yu Sun", "org": "Xuzhou Normal University", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fec5b4"}], "title": "Dependent mechanism of Chinese prepositions processing in the brain: Evidence from event-related potentials", "keywords": ["Chinese", "Difference waves", "Event-related potentials", "Prepositions", "Verbs"], "venue": "Neuroscience Bulletin", "year": 2007, "abstract": "Objective: To compare the event-related potentials (ERPs) waves of verbs and prepositions in the brain.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the value of limb ischemic preconditioning on the donor heart preservation by comparing immature canines limb ischemic preconditioning with the traditional method in heart preservation. METHODS: A total of 12 canines were randomly divided into two groups, with 6 animals in each group. Femoral arteries were liberated and obstructed for 10 minites, followed by open 5 minutes, and then the chest was conventional opened after 3 cycles. The heart was dissociated, and ST. Thomas cardioplegia perfusion was infused via an inserted perfusion tube. The isolated hearts were preserved in the preservation fluid at 4 \u00b0C (3 mL blood was draw from the superior vena venous before the heart was removed). The treatment in the control group was similar to that of the experimental group except that the femoral arteries were not obstructed. The left ventricular myocardial samples were obtained every half an hour in the heart preservation duration (3 hours), and the wet/dry ratio of apical myocardial was measured after preservation. The contents of malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide enzyme (SOD), and cardiac troponin I (cTn-I) were measured. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Compared with the control group, the content of pre-cTn-I had no significant changes (P > 0.05), but the myocardial MDA and wet/dry ratio were smaller (P < 0.05), the SOD was greater (P < 0.05) after heart removal. The results demonstrated that, limb ischemic preconditioning has protective effects on immature heart. The limb ischemic preconditioning before heart removal can increase preservation outcomes of heart and decrease myocardial edema.

One-step approximations to the robust estimators are introduced to reduce computational burden. The one-step local M-estimators are shown to achieve the same efficiency as the fully iterative local M-estimators as long as the initial estimators are good enough. The proposed estimators inherit the excellent edge-effect behavior of the local polynomial methods in the univariate case and at the same time overcome the disadvantages of the local least-squares based smoothers. Simulations are conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed estimators. Real data sets are analyzed to illustrate the practical utility of the proposed methodology. \u00a9 2007 Springer-Verlag.", "pid": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fb4a60"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Jianwen Mao", "org": "Institute of Basic Medical Sciences", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e1519caaa"}, {"name": "Lixin Chen", "org": "Department of Pharmacology", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15113827"}, {"name": "Bin Xu", "org": "Institute of Basic Medical Sciences", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f52361"}, {"name": "Lijing Wang", "org": "Institute of Basic Medical Sciences", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1517ce01"}, {"name": "Weizhang Wang", "org": "Institute of Basic Medical Sciences", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e15212627"}, {"name": "Ming Li", "org": "Institute of Basic Medical Sciences", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1517f519"}, {"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "Institute of Basic Medical Sciences", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1501dd24"}, {"name": "Hongzhi Li", "org": "Institute of Basic Medical Sciences", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151a4587"}, {"name": "Jiao Guo", "org": "Institute of Basic Medical Sciences", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1515ad02"}, {"name": "Weidong Li", "org": "Institute of Basic Medical Sciences", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1505f6b5"}, {"name": "Tim J.C.

Inhibition of AGE/RAGE system has been shown to attenuate neuronal damage. Specific ligands for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3), which have proven effective in the animal models of Alzheimer's disease and other neuroinflammatory diseases, have been shown to decrease RAGE expression. Here we investigated the effect of PPAR\u03b3 agonist, pioglitazone, on cognition function and AGE/RAGE system in a rodent model of insulin resistance, the fructose-drinking rats. Six-week-old male Wistar rats were fed a standard commercial diet and water without (control) or with 10% fructose for 16 weeks. The animals were randomly divided into 4 groups (n = 10): non-treated and water-drinking rats (control group); pioglitazone-treated and water-drinking (control treatment group); non-treated and fructose-drinking rats (fructose group) and pioglitazone-treated and fructose-drinking rats (fructose treatment group). Pioglitazone was given at the dose of 10 mg/kg d by gavage for the last 12 weeks of the 16-week period. The results showed that pioglitazone treatment reduced the escape latency in Morris water maze test, decreased AGE/RAGE expression in the cerebral cortex of fructose-drinking rats. Furthermore, we found that the expression of p47phox component of NAPDH oxidase, phosphorylated nuclear factor NF-\u03baB p65, tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-1 beta was significantly increased in the cerebral cortex of fructose-drinking rats (P < 0.001). These effects were reversed by pioglitazone treatment (P < 0.01 or 0.001). Taken together, these findings suggest that the activation of AGEs-RAGE system contribute to the brain damage of insulin resistance. Pioglitazone administration can improve cognition function probably related to its effect of decreasing the activation of AGEs-RAGE system, which correlates with block of NAPDH oxidase and NF-\u03baB activation in this rodent model of insulin resistance. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of HG on the endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) and its relevance to the activation of the renin-angiotensin system.Methods: Primary human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) were divided into three groups: a normal glucose (NG) group, HG group, and irbesartan (1 \u03bcM)-treated (HG+irbesartan) group. The concentration of angiotensin II in the supernatant was detected by radioimmunoassay. Pathological changes were investigated using fluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy. Immunofluorescence staining was performed to detect the co-expression of CD31 and fibroblast markers, such as fibroblast-specific protein 1 (FSP1). The expressions of FSP1 and \u03b1-SMA were detected by RT-PCR and Western blot.Results: The treatment of HAECs in the HG group resulted in significant increases in the expressions of FSP1 and angiotensin II in dose-and time-dependent manners. The incubation of HAECs exposure to HG resulted in a fibroblast-like phenotype, wherein increased microfilamentation and a roughened endoplasmic reticulum structure were observed in the cytoplasm. The expressions of FSP1 and \u03b1-SMA were significantly increased in the HG group, and these changes were inhibited by irbesartan treatment (P < 0.05). Double staining of the HAECs indicated a co-localization of CD31 and FSP1 and that some cells acquired spindle-shaped morphologies and a loss of CD31 staining; however, treatment with irbesartan attenuated the expression of EndMT (P < 0.05).Conclusions: These findings suggest a novel mechanism in HG-induced endothelial damage via the mediation of the EndMT by angiotensin II, which was inhibited by Irbesartan. \u00a9 2010 Tang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "pid": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151f3b36"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Hou-Yong Dai", "org": "Institute of Nephrology", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15027db7"}, {"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "Institute of Nephrology", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fb8abd"}, {"name": "Ri-Ning Tang", "org": "Institute of Nephrology", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150cc6df"}, {"name": "Jie Ni", "org": "Institute of Nephrology", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f72900"}, {"name": "Kun-Ling Ma", "org": "Institute of Nephrology", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151b4d08"}, {"name": "Qing Li", "org": "Institute of Nephrology", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e15172d07"}, {"name": "Bi-Cheng Liu", "org": "Institute of Nephrology", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150a0b30"}], "title": "Effects of angiotensin receptor blocker on phenotypic alterations of podocytes in early diabetic nephropathy", "keywords": ["Angiotensin II", "Angiotensin receptor blockers", "Diabetic nephropathy", "Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition", "Podocytes"], "venue": "American Journal of the Medical Sciences", "year": 2011, "abstract": "BACKGROUND:: Emerging evidence suggests that podocyte injury is a crucial event in the stage of diabetic nephropathy (DN), a process in which angiotensin II is implicated. In this study, the authors investigated the influence of irbesartan, an angiotensin receptor blocker, on the phenotypic alterations of podocytes in experimental DN. METHODS:: DN was induced by combination of high-sucrose, high-fat diet and intraperitoneal injection of low dose of streptozotocin (35 mg/kg) in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Diabetic rats were treated with irbesartan (50 mg/kg/d) by gavage for 8 weeks. Nondiabetic normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats, which have the same genetic background as spontaneously hypertensive rat, were used as controls. The renal histological changes were investigated by light and electron microscopy. The epithelial marker of nephrin and mesenchymal marker of desmin were detected by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. RESULTS:: Compared with controls, diabetic rats were associated with mesangial matrix deposition, thickening of glomerular basement membrane, albuminuria, loss of podocytes and effacement of foot processes. Furthermore, the expression of nephrin was significantly reduced whereas desmin was increased. Irbesartan treatment not only lowered blood pressure and albuminuria but also attenuated podocyte loss, maintenance of nephrin expression and inhibition of desmin expression. CONCLUSIONS:: This study demonstrates that early irbesartan intervention attenuates the podocyte damage and ameliorates phenotypic alterations of podocytes, which provides a novel insight for the early application of angiotensin receptor blocker to prevent the development of DN. \u00a9 2011 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.", "pid": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f7a918"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "Institute of Nephrology", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fb8abd"}, {"name": "Lin-Li Lv", "org": "Institute of Nephrology", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150d9517"}, {"name": "Jie Ni", "org": "Institute of Nephrology", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f72900"}, {"name": "Hai-Feng Ni", "org": "Institute of Nephrology", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f54752"}, {"name": "Qing Li", "org": "Institute of Nephrology", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e15172d07"}, {"name": "Kun-Ling Ma", "org": "Institute of Nephrology", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151b4d08"}, {"name": "Bi-Cheng Liu", "org": "Institute of Nephrology", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150a0b30"}], "title": "Urinary podocyte-associated mRNA profile in various stages of diabetic nephropathy", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "year": 2011, "abstract": "Background: Podocyte injury and subsequent excretion in urine play a crucial role in the pathogenesis and progression of diabetic nephropathy (DN).

Methods: DN patients (N = 51) and healthy controls (N = 13) were enrolled in this study. DN patients were divided into a normoalbuminuria group (UAE<30 mg/g, n = 17), a microalbuminuria group (UAE 30~300 mg/g, n = 15), and a macroalbuminuria group (UAE>300 mg/g, n = 19), according to their urinary albumin excretion (UAE). Relative mRNA abundance of synaptopodin, podocalyxin, CD2-AP, \u03b1-actin4, and podocin were quantified, and correlations between target mRNAs and clinical parameters were examined. Results: The urinary mRNA levels of all genes studied were significantly higher in the DN group compared with controls (p<0.05), and mRNA levels increased with DN progression. Urinary mRNA levels of all target genes positively correlated with both UAE and BUN.

Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and integrin-linked kinase (ILK) are involved in the progression of DN. However, the underlying mechanisms of EMT are not well understood. The study aimed to investigate the roles of CTGF and ILK in high glucose-induced phenotypic alterations of podocytes and determine whether ILK signaling is downstream of CTGF. The epithelial marker of nephrin and the mesenchymal marker of desmin were investigated by real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting. The results demonstrated that podocytes displayed a spreading, arborized morphology in normal glucose, whereas they had a cobblestone morphology in high glucose conditions, accompanied by decreased nephrin expression and increased desmin expression, suggesting podocytes underwent EMT. In response to high glucose, CTGF and ILK expression in podocytes were increased in a dose- and time-dependent manner, whereas the increase did not occur in the osmotic control. Furthermore, the inhibition of CTGF with anti-CTGF antibody prevented the phenotypic transition, as demonstrated by the preservation of epithelial morphology, the suppression of high glucose-induced desmin overexpression and the restoration of nephrin. Of note, the upregulation of ILK induced by high glucose was partially blocked by the inhibition of CTGF. In summary, these findings suggested that CTGF and ILK were involved in high glucose-induced phenotypic alterations of podocytes. ILK acted as a downstream kinase of CTGF and high glucose-induced ILK expression might occur through CTGF-dependent and -independent pathways.

In the present study, we first investigated the influence of Irbesartan (Irb) on myocardial EndMT in diabetic rats. Methods: Diabetic rats were divided into two groups: the diabetic group (DM) and the Irb-treated group (DM + Irb). Wistar-Kyoto rats served as controls. The pathological changes were investigated by microscopy. Immunofluorescence was performed to evaluate the co-expression of CD31 and fibroblast-specific protein 1 (FSP1). FSP1 and \u03b1-SMA expressions were detected by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. EndMT was also studied in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) that had been exposed to high glucose (HG) levels. Results: Increased interstitial fibrosis was detected in the DM group. Double labeling revealed CD31 expression in FSP1-positive cells in the DM group, and this expression was diminished by Irb treatment (P < 0.05). In vitro, we found that HG stimulated angiotensin II synthesis in HAECs. When HAECs were exposed to HG, some of the cells acquired a spindle-shaped morphology and demonstrated a loss of CD31 labeling, which was attenuated by Irb treatment. FSP1 and \u03b1-SMA mRNA and protein expression levels were markedly upregulated in diabetic rats compared to controls, and their expressions were inhibited by Irb treatment (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The results provide the novel insight that an angiotensin II receptor blocker might prevent diabetic cardiomyopathy by abrogating EndMT in diabetic rats. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.", "pid": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e15189027"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "School of Business", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e151200b5"}], "title": "Study on industrial agglomeration and economic growth : The evidence of Yangtze Delta Area", "keywords": ["Economic growth", "Industrial agglomeration", "Urbanization"], "venue": "2nd International Conference on Information Science and Engineering, ICISE2010 - Proceedings", "year": 2010, "abstract": "We investigate the linear or non-linear relationship between industrial agglomeration and economic growth in Yangtze Delta Area by adopting the analytical method of Brulhart & Sbergami(2009) and using Theil Index and urbanization as indexes of agglomeration.

So it will be more risky for lunar rover to travel on lunar surface than on earth. \u00a9 ASCE 2012.", "pid": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1503bd59"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Mingjing Jiang", "org": "Key Laboratory of Geotechnical and Underground Engineering (Tongji University)", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1511bfdc"}, {"name": "Fang Liu", "org": "Key Laboratory of Geotechnical and Underground Engineering (Tongji University)", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150c0f0d"}, {"name": "Zhifu Shen", "org": "Key Laboratory of Geotechnical and Underground Engineering (Tongji University)", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f81d22"}, {"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "Key Laboratory of Geotechnical and Underground Engineering (Tongji University)", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e15161c57"}], "title": "Distinct element simulation of lugged wheel performance under extraterrestrial environmental effects", "keywords": ["Distinct element method", "Lunar regolith", "Lunar rover", "Non-contact forces", "Rolling resistance", "Soil-wheel interaction"], "venue": "Acta Astronautica", "year": 2014, "abstract": "Lunar regolith demonstrates a high angle of internal friction due to particle angularity and apparent cohesion due to interparticle short-range interaction in lunar environment. This paper investigates the mobility of lunar rovers under partial gravity. A high-efficient contact model of lunar regolith that fuses rolling resistance and van der Waals forces was employed in the distinct element analyses of model wheel tests. Soil behavior and wheel performance under an extraterrestrial environment were analyzed in comparison with that under a terrestrial environment. Results indicate that van der Waals forces enhance the macroscopic shear strength of lunar soils particularly under low confining pressures associated with microgravity conditions. In the extraterrestrial environment, the mobility of a lugged wheel becomes not as well as expected due to more slippage and sinkage than that in the terrestrial environment, while it moves more efficiently in view of tractive efficiency. Increased slip ratio and sinkage on the lunar surface are attributed to loosely packing of soil particles in microgravity conditions, where reduced wheel load plays only minor role in improving the mobility of the wheel. Van der Waals forces between soil grains are beneficial to the wheel performance due to increased strength in soils, while this contribution is overwhelmed by the effect of largely reduced confining pressure in soils due to partial gravity on the Moon. \u00a9 2014 IAA.", "pid": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150be8cc"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "Key Laboratory of Microsystems and Microstructures Manufacturing", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fad600"}, {"name": "Yan Cui", "org": "Key Laboratory of Microsystems and Microstructures Manufacturing", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1506cbfb"}, {"name": "Xinyu Li", "org": "Key Laboratory of Microsystems and Microstructures Manufacturing", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fa8910"}, {"name": "Shaoqin Liu", "org": "Key Laboratory of Microsystems and Microstructures Manufacturing", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1509a5e4"}, {"name": "Zhiyong Tang", "org": "National Center for Nanotechnology and Science", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fd9f47"}], "title": "Photoelectrochemical sensing of glucose based on quantum dot and enzyme nanocomposites", "keywords": ["Glucose oxidase", "Nanocomposite", "Photoelectrochemical sensor", "Quantum dots"], "venue": "Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry", "year": 2011, "abstract": "A simple procedure for constructing the photoelectrochemical biosensor based on TiO", "pid": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150a79e9"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Yan Cui", "org": "Key Laboratory of Microsystems and Microstructures Manufacturing", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1506cbfb"}, {"name": "Hongyue Chen", "org": "Key Laboratory of Microsystems and Microstructures Manufacturing", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1513f83b"}, {"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "Key Laboratory of Microsystems and Microstructures Manufacturing", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fad600"}, {"name": "Zhifei Dai", "org": "Nanobiotechnology Division", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1503d35d"}, {"name": "Shaoqin Liu", "org": "Key Laboratory of Microsystems and Microstructures Manufacturing", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1509a5e4"}], "title": "CdSe@CdS core-shell quantum dot-polymer multilayer sensitized TiO 2 for photovoltaics", "keywords": ["CdSe@CdS core-shell quantum dots", "Layer-by-layer deposition", "QD-sensitized solar cells", "TiO 2 films"], "venue": "Journal of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology", "year": 2011, "abstract": "Colloidal CdSe@CdS core-shell quantum dots (QDs) have been prepared and exploited as inorganic dyes to sensitize a large-band-gap TiO ", "pid": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150b4dbf"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "School of Electronics and Info.

Proteomic screening for cellular proteins which interact with NS1 identified the cellular protein RAP55, which is one of the components of cellular processing bodies (P-bodies) and stress granules. To verify whether NS1 interacts with cellular P-bodies, interactions between NS1, RAP55, and other P-body-associated proteins (Ago1, Ago2, and DCP1a) were confirmed using coimmunoprecipitation and cellular colocalization assays. Overexpression of RAP55 induced RAP55-associated stress granule formation and suppressed virus replication. Knockdown of RAP55 with small interfering RNA (siRNA) or expression of a dominant-negative mutant RAP55 protein with defective interaction with P-bodies blocked NS1 colocalization to P-bodies in cells. Expression of NS1 inhibited RAP55 expression and formation of RAP55-associated P-bodies/stress granules. The viral nucleoprotein (NP) was found to be targeted to stress granules in the absence of NS1 but localized to P-bodies when NS1 was coexpressed. Restriction of virus replication via P-bodies occurred in the early phases of infection, as the number of RAP55-associated P-bodies in cells diminished over the course of virus infection. NS1 interaction with RAP55-associated P-bodies/stress granules was associated with RNA binding and mediated via a protein kinase R (PKR)-interacting viral element. Mutations introduced into either RNA binding sites (R38 and K41) or PKR interaction sites (I123, M124, K126, and N127) caused NS1 proteins to lose the ability to interact with RAP55 and to inhibit stress granules. These results reveal an interplay between virus and host during virus replication in which NP is targeted to P-bodies/stress granules while NS1 counteracts this host restriction mechanism. \u00a9 2012, American Society for Microbiology.", "pid": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150ee613"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Xi Wen", "org": "Research Centre of Infection and Immunology, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1511a215"}, {"name": "Xiaofeng Huang", "org": "Research Centre of Infection and Immunology, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fdcef7"}, {"name": "Bobo Wing-Yee Mok", "org": "Research Centre of Infection and Immunology, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e15193ed9"}, {"name": "Yixin Chen", "org": "National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development for Infectious Diseases, School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f79495"}, {"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "Research Centre of Infection and Immunology, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150e2e94"}, {"name": "Siu-Ying Lau", "org": "Research Centre of Infection and Immunology, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1519718e"}, {"name": "Pui Wang", "org": "Research Centre of Infection and Immunology, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e1519f940"}, {"name": "Wenjun Song", "org": "Research Centre of Infection and Immunology, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fd2c31"}, {"name": "Dong-Yan Jin", "org": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e152104cc"}, {"name": "Kwok-Yung Yuen", "org": "Research Centre of Infection and Immunology, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fe1626"}, {"name": "Honglin Chen", "org": "Research Centre of Infection and Immunology, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150a64d8"}], "title": "NF90 exerts antiviral activity through regulation of PKR phosphorylation and stress granules in infected cells", "venue": "Journal of Immunology", "year": 2014, "abstract": "NF90 was shown to exhibit broad antiviral activity against several viruses, but detailed mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we examined the molecular basis for the inhibitory effect of NF90 on virus replication mediated through protein kinase (PKR)-associated translational regulation. We first verified the interaction between NF90 and PKR in mammalian cells and showed that NF90 interacts with PKR through its C-terminal and that the interaction is independent of NF90 RNA-binding properties. We further showed that knockdown of NF90 resulted in significantly lower levels of PKR phosphorylation in response to dsRNA induction and influenza virus infection.We also showed that high concentrations of NF90 exhibit negative regulatory effects on PKR phosphorylation, presumably through competition for dsRNAvia the C-terminal RNA-binding domain. PKR activation is essential for the formation of stress granules in response to dsRNA induction. Our results showed that NF90 is a component of stress granules. In NF90-knockdown cells, dsRNA treatment induced significantly lower levels of stress granules than in control cells. Further evidence for an NF90-PKR antiviral pathway was obtained using an NS1 mutated influenza A virus specifically attenuated in its ability to inhibit PKR activation. This mutant virus replicated indistinguishably from wild-type virus in NF90-knockdown cells, but not in scrambled control cells or Vero cells, indicating that NF90's antiviral function occurs through interaction with PKR. Taken together, these results reveal a yet-to-be defined host antiviral mechanism in which NF90 upregulation of PKR phosphorylation restricts virus infection.

Influenza viruses with NS1 deletions (DelNS1 influenza viruses) are a useful tool for studying virus replication and can serve as effective live attenuated vaccines, but deletion of NS1 severely diminishes virus replication, hampering functional studies and vaccine production.Wefound that WSN-DelNS1 viruses passaged in cells consistently adapted to gain an A14U substitution in the 3' noncoding region of theMsegment of viralRNA (vRNA) which restored replicative ability. DelNS1-M-A14U viruses cannot inhibit interferon expression in virus infected-cells, providing an essential model for studying virus replication in the absence of the NS1 protein. Characterization of DelNS1-M-A14U virus showed that the lack of NS1 has no apparent effect on expression of other viral proteins, with the exception ofMmRNAs. Expression of theMtranscripts, M1, M2, mRNA3, and mRNA4, is regulated by alternative splicing. The A14U substitution changes the splicing donor site consensus sequence of mRNA3, altering expression ofMtranscripts, withM2expression significantly increased andmRNA3 markedly suppressed in DelNS1-M-A14U, but not DelNS1-M-WT, virus-infected cells. Further analysis revealed that the A14U substitution also affects promoter function during replication of the viral genome. The M-A14U mutation increasesMvRNA synthesis in DelNS1 virus infection and enhances alternative splicing ofM2mRNAin the absence of other viral proteins.

The beneficial effects of curcumin in diseases such as arthritis, allergy, asthma, atherosclerosis, diabetes and cancer may be due to its immunomodulatory properties. We studied the potential of curcumin to modulate CD4 + T cells-mediated autoimmune disease, by examining the effects of this compound on human CD4 + lymphocyte activation. Stimulation of human T cells with PHA or CD3/CD28 induced IL-2 mRNA expression and activated the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. The treatment of T cells with curcumin induced the unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling pathway, initiated by the phosphorylation of PERK and IRE1. Furthermore, curcumin increased the expression of the ER stress associated transcriptional factors XBP-1, cleaved p50ATF6\u03b1 and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) in human CD4 + and Jurkat T cells. In PHA-activated T cells, curcumin further enhanced PHA-induced CHOP expression and reduced the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Finally, curcumin treatment induced apoptotic cell death in activated T cells via eliciting an excessive ER stress response, which was reversed by the ER-stress inhibitor 4-phenylbutyric acid or transfection with CHOP-specific siRNA. These results suggest that curcumin can impact both ER stress and mitochondria functional pathways, and thereby could be used as a promising therapy in the context of Th1-mediated autoimmune diseases. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.", "pid": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150c5ce4"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "Department of Medical Science", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151f11a9"}, {"name": "Qinggao Zhang", "org": "College of Basic Medicine", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e1519e2e3"}, {"name": "Yeonsoo Joe", "org": "School of Biological Sciences", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e151163e2"}, {"name": "Seul-Ki Kim", "org": "School of Biological Sciences", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1507a82d"}, {"name": "Md.

We hypothesized that CO could inhibit leptin resistance during ER stress. Thapsigargin or tunicamycin was used to induce ER stress in human cells expressing the leptin receptor. These agents markedly inhibited leptin-induced STAT3 phosphorylation, confirming that ER stress induces leptin resistance. The CO-releasing molecule CORM-2 blocked the ER stress-dependent inhibition of leptin-induced STAT3 phosphorylation. CORM-2 treatment induced the phosphorylation of protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), and eukaryotic translation initiation factor-2\u03b1 and enhanced PERK phosphorylation during ER stress.

However, it was not clear whether the two molecules are functionally linked. In this study, we sought to determine whether HO-1 associates with TTP to mediate the anti-inflammatory effects of nicotine. Inhibition of HO-1 activity or HO-1 expression attenuated the effects of nicotine on STAT3 activation, TTP induction, and TNF-\u03b1 production in LPS-treated macrophages. Induction of HO-1 expression increased the level of TTP in the absence of nicotine. In an LPS-induced endotoxemia model, HO-1 deficiency blocked the effects of nicotine on the STAT3 phosphorylation, TTP induction, and LPS-induced TNF-\u03b1 production in the liver. Downregulation of STAT3 by siRNA attenuated the effect of nicotine on TTP expression and TNF-\u03b1 production but did not affect the nicotine-mediated induction of HO-1. In TTP knockout mice, nicotine treatment enhanced HO-1 expression and STAT3 activation but failed to inhibit LPS-induced TNF-\u03b1 production. Our results suggest that HO-1 and TTP are functionally linked in mediating the anti-inflammatory effects of nicotine; HO-1 is necessary for the induction of TTP by nicotine.

We found that several ER stress-inducing chemicals and the free fatty acid palmitate can trigger IL-1\u03b2 secretion in various cell types, including monocytic leukemia cells, primary macrophages and differentiated adipocytes. We show that ER stress primes cells for the expression of pro-IL-1\u03b2 via NF-\u03baB activation and promotes IL-1\u03b2 secretion.

Chemical chaperone treatment and the pharmacological application of carbon monoxide inhibited IL-1\u03b2 secretion in response to ER stress.

In this modulation, two rotation states of the circle polarization light (left handed and right handed) representation logic signal '0' and '1', are used to information loaded and data transmission.

The transformation and evaluation processes of ADAM are fully automatic, generic, and extensible for different types of malware, anti-virus systems, and malware transformation techniques. We demonstrate the efficacy of ADAM using 222 Android malware samples that we collected in the wild.

However, it also attracts malware writers to exploit Android devices in order to distribute malicious apps in the wild. In fact, Android malware are becoming more sophisticated and they use advanced 'dynamic loading' techniques like Java reflection or native code execution to bypass security detection. To detect dynamic loading, one has to use dynamic analysis. Currently, there are only a handful of Android dynamic analysis tools available, and they all have shortcomings in detecting dynamic loading. The aim of this paper is to design and implement a dynamic analysis system which allows analysts to perform systematic analysis of dynamic payloads with malicious behaviors. We propose 'DroidTrace', a ptrace based dynamic analysis system with forward execution capability. Our system uses ptrace to monitor selected system calls of the target process which is running the dynamic payloads, and classifies the payloads behaviors through the system call sequence, e.g., behaviors such as file access, network connection, inter-process communication and even privilege escalation. Also, DroidTrace performs 'physical modification' to trigger different dynamic loading behaviors within an app. Using DroidTrace, we carry out a large scale analysis on 36,170 dynamic payloads in 50,000 apps and 294 malware in 10 families (four of them are zero-day) with various dynamic loading behaviors.", "pid": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f88d07"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "Chinese University of Hong Kong", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15ff0f2d"}, {"name": "Hui Xue", "org": "FireEye Inc.", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e151ff725"}, {"name": "Yulong Zhang", "org": "FireEye Inc.", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151dfe2a"}, {"name": "Tao Wei", "org": "FireEye Inc.", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15114a3e"}, {"name": "John C.S.

However, both jailbroken and nonjailbroken iOS devices have number of vulnerabilities. For iOS, apps need to interact with the underlying system using Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).

These APIs, also known as \"private APIs\", provide powerful features to developers and yet they may have serious security consequences if misused. Furthermore, apps which use private APIs can bypass the App Store and use the \"Apple's Enterprise/Developer Certificates\" for distribution. This poses a significant threat to the iOS ecosystem. So far, there is no formal study to understand these apps and how private APIs are being encapsulated. We call these iOS apps which distribute to the public using enterprise certificates as \"enpublic\" apps. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of iAnalytics, which can automatically analyze \"enpublic\" apps' private API usages and vulnerabilities. Using iAnalytics, we crawled and analyzed 1,408 enpublic iOS apps. We discovered that: 844 (60%) out of the 1408 apps do use private APIs, 14 (1%) apps contain URL scheme vulnerabilities, 901 (64%) enpublic apps transport sensitive information through unencrypted channel or store the information in plaintext on the phone.

The BNA15 sequence in the Dajiuhu peat deposit shows a trend similar to the paleotemperature record derived from pollen results over the last 13 ka, further supporting that BNA15 is a sensitive proxy of paleotemperature. Absolute temperatures estimated from BNA15 values of modern surface peats are about 3-4\u00b0C lower than the modern annual mean air temperature in the peatland, which may result from the influences of factors other than temperature or from the different microbial communities in the mountain soils used to calibrate the BNA15 acidic peats.

Collagen synthesis is, in part, under the influence of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). We investigated the associations between cAMP, myopia development in guinea pigs, and collagen synthesis by human scleral fibroblasts (HSFs). Form-deprived myopia (FDM) was induced by unilateral masking of guinea pig eyes. Scleral cAMP levels increased selectively in the FDM eyes and returned to normal levels after unmasking and recovery. Unilateral subconjunctival treatment with the adenylyl cyclase (AC) activator forskolin resulted in a myopic shift accompanied by reduced collagen mRNA levels, but it did not affect retinal electroretinograms.

Selective regulation of cAMP to control scleral collagen synthesis may be a novel therapeutic strategy for preventing and treating myopia. \u00a9 2013 Tao et al.", "pid": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e15136b44"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "China University of Geosciences", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1510d35f"}, {"name": "Xiaogang Luo", "org": "Key Laboratory for Green Chemical Process of Ministry of Education", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f65083"}], "title": "Phase Structure and Properties of Toughened Poly(L-Lactic Acid)/Glycidyl Methacrylate Grafted Poly(Ethylene Octane) Blends Adjusted by the Stereocomplex", "keywords": ["Blends", "Phase structure", "Poly(ethylene octane)", "Poly(L-lactic acid)", "Stereocomplex", "Toughness"], "venue": "Polymer - Plastics Technology and Engineering", "year": 2013, "abstract": "A detailed study of reactively toughened poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA)/glycidyl methacrylate grafted poly(ethylene octane) blends is reported, and stereocomplex (SC) formed from PDLA incorporated was used to adjust the phase morphology.

Thus, management and monitoring of power facilities is important. Traditional engineering measures have the drawbacks of high workload, high risk, and low efficiency. Airborne LiDAR can overcome these drawbacks, and cannot be easily affected by environment, making LiDAR an important development trend for power line measurement. At present, airborne LiDAR is mainly used for the reconstruction of urban areas and natural features; extraction and modeling of power facilities is still in its infancy. The main problems are too much human intervention, low accuracy, and lack of continuity. Therefore, this paper proposes a new method based on the analysis of the characteristics of power facilities and extraction algorithm. First, the optimal catenary fitting geometry model of the powerline was obtained based on the powerline characteristics. The nonlinear catenary equation was simplified to linear polynomial form based on the principle of Lagrange polynomial to improve the operation efficiency. Second, the projection direction of the powerline in the XOY plane was determined based on a statistic method. Afterward, the vertical plane that contains the starting and end points and are perpendicular to the power line were also determined based on the characteristic of the end laser point. The distance of all points to the plane as X-axis parameters was calculated and the points corresponding to the Z coordinate values as Y-axis parameters were obtained to determine the optimal plane coordinate system. Finally, the quadratic-polynomial-limited least square method was used to fit the powerlines, obtain the optimal parameters, and generate the final power line model. Experiments on real data showed that the proposed method improved the facility and veracity of powerline fitting. The precision reached \u00b11.740 cm both in the vertical and horizontal planes. The proposed method can quickly fit the powerline and reach a high accuracy, which are significant in the study of 3D reconstruction by LiDAR point cloud.", "pid": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fc992a"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Xudong Lai", "org": "Collaborative Innovation Center for Geospatial Technology", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1516a5db"}, {"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "School of Remote Sensing and Information Engineering, Wuhan University", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1505ff09"}], "title": "A denoising method for LiDAR full-waveform data", "venue": "Mathematical Problems in Engineering", "year": 2015, "abstract": "Decomposition of LiDAR full-waveform data can not only enhance the density and positioning accuracy of a point cloud, but also provide other useful parameters, such as pulse width, peak amplitude, and peak position which are important information for subsequent processing.

MinE of the Min system forms a ring-like structure that plays a critical role in triggering the oscillation cycle. However, the mechanism underlying the formation of the MinE ring remains unclear. This study demonstrates that MinE self-assembles into fibrillar structures on the supported lipid bilayer. The MinD-interacting domain of MinE shows amyloidogenic properties, providing a possible mechanism for self-assembly of MinE. Supporting the idea, mutations in residues Ile-24 and Ile-25 of the MinD-interacting domain affect fibril formation, membrane binding ability of MinE and MinD, and subcellular localization of three Min proteins. Additional mutations in residues Ile-72 and Ile-74 suggest a role of the C-terminal domain of MinE in regulating the folding propensity of the MinD-interacting domain for different molecular interactions. The study suggests a self-assembly mechanism that may underlie the ring-like structure formed by MinE-GFP observed in vivo. \u00a9 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.", "pid": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1516e590"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Mei-Hua Guo", "org": "Kunming Medical University, Institute of Dermatology and Venereology of Yunnan Province", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e151081ab"}, {"name": "Wen-Juan Wu", "org": "Kunming Medical University, Institute of Dermatology and Venereology of Yunnan Province", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e15104560"}, {"name": "Long Fan", "org": "2KIZ/CUHK Joint Laboratory of Bioresources and Molecular Research in Common Diseases", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e150745e3"}, {"name": "Min-Sheng Peng", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Genetic Resources and Evolution, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e1519ebeb"}, {"name": "Jian-Kang Yang", "org": "Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Bio-Resources, Key Laboratory for Microbial Resources, Yunnan University", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e15178803"}, {"name": "Wen Zhang", "org": "Key Laboratory of Animal Models and Human Disease Mechanisms, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1503d25b"}, {"name": "Fei Hao", "org": "Department of Dermatology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e15146154"}, {"name": "Hong-Fu Xie", "org": "Department of Dermatology, Xiangya Hospital Central South University", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1501f12d"}, {"name": "Lei-Hong Xiang", "org": "Department of Dermatology, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15015dcf"}, {"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "Department of Dermatology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang, University School of Medicine", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1516959d"}, {"name": "Yan-Ni Guo", "org": "Department of Dermatology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Fujian Medical University", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fee72f"}, {"name": "Qing-Hua Song", "org": "Department of Dermatology, Peking University Third Hospital", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15009622"}, {"name": "Cai-Xia Tu", "org": "Department of Dermatology, Second Hospital of Dalian Medical University", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e1519a7bb"}, {"name": "Hua Zhong", "org": "Department of Dermatology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150ba7dd"}, {"name": "Wen-Ge Fan", "org": "Department of Dermatology, Changshu NO.1 People's Hospital", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fb1784"}, {"name": "Yue-Jun Shi", "org": "Department of Dermatology, Dalian Dermatosis Hospital", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e152087e5"}, {"name": "Ping Cao", "org": "Department of Dermatology, First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f6e0d2"}, {"name": "Lian-Yuan Feng", "org": "Yuxi Lianyuan Hospital", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fe8c44"}, {"name": "Meng Na", "org": "Department of Dermatology, Kaiyuan People's Hospital", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151b5db6"}, {"name": "Qin Pang", "org": "Winona Dermo-Cosmetology Center", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151ee749"}, {"name": "Xiao-Yan Yang", "org": "Winona Dermo-Cosmetology Center", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e1509f9db"}, {"name": "Cheng Yang", "org": "Winona Dermo-Cosmetology Center", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15faf7e5"}, {"name": "Xi Zou", "org": "Winona Dermo-Cosmetology Center", "id": "5b5433e3e1cd8e4e15f456ac"}, {"name": "Li He", "org": "Kunming Medical University, Institute of Dermatology and Venereology of Yunnan Province", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1518fddc"}, {"name": "Ya-Ping Zhang", "org": "Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Bio-Resources, Key Laboratory for Microbial Resources, Yunnan University", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e15062fd0"}], "title": "No association between y chromosomal haplogroups and severe acne in the Han Chinese population", "venue": "Journal of Human Genetics", "year": 2014, "abstract": "Severe acne presents sexual dimorphism in its incidence in Chinese population.

The virus was identified and then isolated from hens suffering from severe egg drop and fever in Fujian Province, China. The virus replicated well in MDEF and CEF cells, and its cytopathogenic effect (CPE) was apparent. Hemagglutinating activity (HA) was negative for this virus using erythrocytes from both chickens and pigeons. Viral particles were enveloped and approximately 45 nm in diameter, as observed by electron microscopy. Phylogenetic analysis of the full-length nucleotide sequence of CJD05 indicated that this virus is closely related to the duck-origin TMUV, belonging to Ntaya group of flavivirus. Most importantly, pathogenicity studies showed that CJD05 is highly virulent in 1-day-old chicks, 1-day-old Muscovy ducks, egg-laying chickens and shelducks.

CRI value was examined in the range of 56.8-76.0 due to the change of phosphor concentration, for traditional blue-pumped yellow phosphor. When red phosphor was added, it was found that as red contents increased, red shift occurred in CIE, and CRI value was enhanced only within a limited range. The highest enhancement in such case was 13.8% for blue-pumped yellow phosphor, and when more multi-chromatic phosphor such as red, yellow, green was mixed, the value of CRI enhancement was 19.2% higher than that of dichromatic LED. Ray tracing simulation revealed that multi-chromatic phosphor also had an impact on luminous efficacy and color temperature for high-power WLED devices. It was also showed in our simulation that CRI value increased with the increase of total phosphor concentration, up until the point of an optimum concentration where CRI value started to decrease. Other parameters such as quantum efficiency and molar absorbance index also contributed to white-LED devices performance. Such simulation results are useful to design the optimum phosphor mixture concentration and are helpful to fabricate high CRI blue-pumped or ultraviolet-pumped WLED devices with the best multi-chromatic phosphor proportion.", "pid": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150e3603"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Yukun Zhao", "org": "Solid-State Lighting Engineering Research Center, Xi'An Jiaotong University", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1506d017"}, {"name": "Feng Yun", "org": "Shaanxi Supernova Lighting Technology Co.

It was noticed that Kupffer cells activation at the initial phase was involved in some intense inflammatory responses in the pathogenesis of ALF. However, detailed regulation mechanism of Kupffer cells activation during ALF is still obscured. Present study aimed to discover the potential regulator and explore deeper information of Kupffer cells activation at the early stage of ALF. Methods: The mouse model of ALF was established by Concanavalin A injection. Dynamic immunological statuses of Kupffer cells at the early stage of ALF were exhibited by detecting typical cytokines. The expression of inflammasome AIM2 was measured in both RNA and protein level. Its role of affecting Kupffer cells activation during ALF by inducing IL-1\u03b2 production was identified by RNA interference in vitro. Moreover, the expression of miR-223 in vivo was measured by q-PCR and its role in regulating Kupffer cells activation during Con A induced ALF was determined by RNAs transfection. Results: Present study showed that mass production of IL-1\u03b2 from isolated Kupffer cells in Con A treated mice might be the main driving force of Kupffer cells pro-inflammatory activation during ALF. The role of AIM2 in affecting pro-inflammatory activation of Kupffer cells by inducing IL-1\u03b2 production was crucial to ALF. Further study found that miR-223 acted as a regulator in Kupffer cells activation at the early stage of ALF by influencing IL-1\u03b2 production via AIM2 pathway. Conclusion: For the first time, this paper demonstrated that miR-223 acted to inhibit IL-1\u03b2 production via AIM2 pathway, suppressing Kupffer cells pro-inflammatory activation at the early stage of ALF.

Methods: A fulminant hepatitis model was established successfully by the intravenous administration of Con A (20 mg/kg) to male Balb/c mice. Emodin was administered to the mice by gavage before and after Con A injection. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, numbers of CD4<sup>+</sup> and F4/80<sup>+</sup> cells infiltrated into the liver, and amounts of phosphorylated p38 MAPK and NF-\u03baB in mouse livers and RAW264.7 and EL4 cells were measured. Results: Pretreatment with emodin significantly protected the animals from T cell-mediated hepatitis, as shown by the decreased elevations of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), as well as reduced hepatic necrosis. In addition, emodin pretreatment markedly reduced the intrahepatic expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-12, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), integrin alpha M (ITGAM), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP-2) and chemokine (CXC motif) receptor 2 (CXCR2).

Among them, ITE enhances the binding of the AhR to the promoter of Oct4 and suppresses its transcription. Reduction of endogenous ITE levels in cancer cells by tryptophan deprivation or hypoxia leads to Oct4 elevation, which can be reverted by administration with synthetic ITE. Consequently, synthetic ITE induces the differentiation of stem-like cancer cells and reduces their tumorigenic potential in both subcutaneous and orthotopic xenograft tumour models.

In VPA-treated AD mouse brain, inactivated GSK-3\u03b2 (pSer9-GSK-3\u03b2) was markedly increased, while hyperphosphorylation of tau at Ser396 and Ser262 was decreased; total tau levels remained similar. VPA treatment notably improved pSer133-cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels, which are associated with synaptic function and neurite outgrowth. Conclusion: VPA improves behavioral deficits in AD, modifies synaptic structure, and accelerates neurite outgrowth, by inhibiting the activity of GSK-3\u03b2, decreasing hyperphosphorylated tau, enhancing CREB and BDNF expression.", "pid": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e1510765e"}, {"authors": [{"name": "He Yu", "org": "Faculty of Chemical Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1502ed9e"}, {"name": "Fa-She Li", "org": "Faculty of Metallurgy and Energy Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1503c6c4"}, {"name": "Xing Zhu", "org": "Faculty of Metallurgy and Energy Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150c3784"}, {"name": "Yong-Gang Wei", "org": "Faculty of Metallurgy and Energy Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fda116"}, {"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "Faculty of Metallurgy and Energy Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f867dc"}, {"name": "Hua Wang", "org": "Faculty of Metallurgy and Energy Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1517f7f7"}, {"name": "Kong-Zhai Li", "org": "Faculty of Metallurgy and Energy Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f922cc"}], "title": "Monolithic Ce-Fe-Zr-O/MgO oxygen carrier for the chemical-looping partial oxidation of methane to syngas", "keywords": ["Chemical looping", "Methane", "Monolithic oxygen carrier", "Partial oxidation", "Syngas"], "venue": "Ranliao Huaxue Xuebao/Journal of Fuel Chemistry and Technology", "year": 2015, "abstract": "With MgO as support, powdery Ce-Fe-Zr-O/MgO oxygen carrier was prepared by a ball milling method and monolithic Ce-Fe-Zr-O/MgO oxygen carrier was further obtained by extrusion molding method.

One of the important distinctions between the marine splash zone and the normal atmospheric zone is the wetting condition of steel surfaces. However even in the same splash zone, the corrosion rate of one spot is different to that of the other ones on the surface of one steel pile, thereby on which a corrosion rate peak should exist at a specific spot. In order to reveal the nature of the difference in corrosion rate at different positions of a steel pile, the variations of the wetting condition of steel specimens with tidal movement was monitored, while the specimens located at different positions along a vertical line passing the tide zone. It follows that the wetting degree of the steel specimen in the splash zone is closely related with its location and the tidal movement, and which substantially follows an overall trend that the wetting degree increases with the rising tide level and decrease with the lowering tide level; the wetting degree of the steel specimen increases with the increase of exposure time. But for a specific moment, a certain relationship dose not exist for the wetting degree with the tide movement and the location of steel specimen. Even though by the time of the low tide level the steel specimen located in splash zone is still in a wet condition due to the effect of the high air humidity and flying seawater foam, which correlates also to the high moisture absorption characteristics of corrosion products scale on the carbon steel. The extreme corrosion rate of the steel in splash zone corresponds to a specific wetting degree. Furthermore, on the area below the extreme point, thin water film on the surface of steel specimens can often be observed by naked eyes, which is consistent with the relationship between corrosion rate and thickness of liquid film on the metal surface.", "pid": "5b5433e3e1cd8e4e15f3fdc6"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Yuan Chen", "org": "Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fa1237"}, {"name": "Lin Ma", "org": "Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150dd176"}, {"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15020ef9"}, {"name": "Kai Yu", "org": "Nanjing Broad Band Wireless Communication Research Center", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f6d9d6"}], "title": "A trust routing protocol based on D-S evidence theory in mobile ad hoc network", "keywords": ["Ad hoc network", "D-S evidence theory", "MPR", "OLSR", "Selfish nodes", "Trust evaluation"], "venue": "2014 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China, ICCC 2014", "year": 2015, "abstract": "Specific to reliability and security issues in mobile ad hoc network, a trust evaluation model based on Dempster-Shafer evidence theory is proposed.

Our previous study has identified KPNA2 overexpression in epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) tissues, which predicts poor prognosis. However, the mechanism of KPNA2 overexpression in EOC remains unclear. This study aimed to examine the role of miRNA in KPNA2 dysregulation. Our results showed that miR-26b was downregulated in EOC samples, and correlated inversely with KPNA2 expression. Low expression of miR-26b was associated with advanced FIGO stage, poor differentiation, higher risk of distant metastasis and recurrence. Downregulation of miR-26b predicted poor disease-free survival and overall survival in EOC patients. KPNA2 was validated as a direct target of miR-26b. Knockdown of KPNA2 or ectopic expression of miR-26b could downregulate OCT4, vimentin and upregulate E-cadherin. Reintroduction of KPNA2 partially abrogated the suppression effect induced by miR-26b. We further verified that miR-26b/KPNA2/OCT4 axis inhibited EOC cell viability, migratory ability and sphere-forming capacity in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, our results reveal that miR-26b is downregulated in EOC, and directly targets KPNA2. miR-26b/ KPNA2 axis suppresses tumor proliferation and metastasis through decreasing OCT4 expression, which is indicative of the important role of miR-26b/KPNA2/OCT4 axis in EOC carcinogenesis and progression.", "pid": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f56f7f"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Lan Zhang", "org": "Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15faac59"}, {"name": "Jian-Hua Wang", "org": "Cardiovascular Department", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151e82e8"}, {"name": "Rong-Xin Liang", "org": "Cardiovascular Department", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e15077c39"}, {"name": "Shu-Ting Huang", "org": "Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150d6f52"}, {"name": "Jing Xu", "org": "Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fe8234"}, {"name": "Lin-Jing Yuan", "org": "Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fec40a"}, {"name": "Long Huang", "org": "Department of Oncology", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e151f87a8"}, {"name": "Yun Zhou", "org": "Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e15158b0e"}, {"name": "Xing-Juan Yu", "org": "Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151c6ea8"}, {"name": "Shao-Yun Wu", "org": "Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e15090faf"}, {"name": "Rong-Zhen Luo", "org": "Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fab775"}, {"name": "Jing-Ping Yun", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fab449"}, {"name": "Wei-Hua Jia", "org": "Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e150280f5"}, {"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151d9add"}], "title": "RASSF8 downregulation promotes lymphangiogenesis and metastasis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma", "keywords": ["Esophageal cancer", "Lymphangiogenesis", "RASSF8", "Tumor metastasis"], "venue": "Oncotarget", "year": 2015, "abstract": "Lymphatic vessels are the major routes of human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) metastasis.

The xCELLigence, Flow cytometry, RT-PCR and Western blot were used to analyze the cell proliferation, cell apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, anti-tumor genes, and protein expression. Results: miR-34a was up-regulated in HepG2 cells treated by quercetin exhibiting wild-type p53.

However, shale oil mobility evaluation affects the exploration and development of shale oil. This study proposes a kind of evaluation method of movable resources amount of shale oil, and includes the following points: (1) The division of shale layer-system and recognition criteria were defined in detail as follows: The start and end sections are greater than 2 m shale section. The organic matter maturity and average organic carbon in a single shale layer are greater than 0.5%. Single sandstone thickness is less than 2 m. Thin sand layer thickness within accumulated 10 m-scope is less than 4 m. The total thickness is greater than or equal to 30 m. The movable resource evaluation of shale oil refers to the narrow sense. (2) Adsorption oil evaluation model of shale oil, which is established based on shale volume (distribution, thickness), organic carbon and shale density and saturated adsorption coefficient. (3) In situ shale oil evaluation model, which is established depending on the four Parameters: percentage of shale oil, shale volume (distribution, thickness), rock density, heavy hydrocarbon compensation and light hydrocarbon recovery coefficient. (4) Movable resources amount of shale oil. According to material balance principle, movable resources amount of shale oil equals to the amount where in situ resources amount of oil shale minus shale saturated adsorption oil amount.

In the present study, we provided evidence that the transcripts of authentic OCT4 gene (OCT4A) and its multiple pseudogenes were detected in a variety of cancer cell lines. A few major bands were also detected by western blotting using an anti-Oct4A monoclonal antibody. Moreover, an anti-Oct4-pT235 antibody was used to identify a band in the majority of the tested cancer cell lines that coincided with one of the anti-Oct4A bands which was decreasable by a specific shRNA. The Oct4-pT235 signals were also detected in human glioblastoma and liver cancer specimens by immunofluorescence microscopy and immunohistochemistry. U87 glioblastoma cells were cultured in a neural stem cell medium to induce the formation of neurospheres rich in stem-like cancer cells. The levels of Oct4-pT235 in the sphere cells were markedly increased compared to their monolayer parental cells, a result that was accompanied by upregulation of the PI3K-Akt pathway. Akti-1/2, a specific inhibitor of Akt, effectively reduced the level of Oct4-pT235 and attenuated the proliferation of U87 sphere cells. ITE, an agonist of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, also significantly attenuated the Akt-mediated phosphorylation of Oct4 in glioblastoma and liver cancer cells, and reduced their tumorigenic potential in a xenograft tumor model. Taken together, we concluded that the Akt-mediated phosphorylation of Oct4A or its homolog protein was associated with the proliferation of stem-like cancer cells that may serve as a novel biomarker and drug target for certain types of cancer.", "pid": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e1500a9df"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Jinghao Huo", "org": "Institute of Materials Physical Chemistry, Huaqiao University", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fb76fd"}, {"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "Institute of Materials Physical Chemistry, Huaqiao University", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e15148cd3"}, {"name": "Yongguang Tu", "org": "Institute of Materials Physical Chemistry, Huaqiao University", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e1520fa29"}, {"name": "Jihuai Wu", "org": "Institute of Materials Physical Chemistry, Huaqiao University", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fc30f8"}, {"name": "Linhua Hu", "org": "Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, CAS", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151da5f0"}, {"name": "Songyuan Dai", "org": "Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, CAS", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1518aa9e"}], "title": "A high performance cobalt sulfide counter electrode for dye-sensitized solar cells", "keywords": ["CoS", "dye-sensitized solar cell counter electrode", "NaBH4-H2SO4"], "venue": "Electrochimica Acta", "year": 2015, "abstract": "A cobalt sulfide (CoS) thin film is deposited on fluorine doped SnO", "pid": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fe44a5"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Jia Dong", "org": "Engineering Research Center of Environment-Friendly Functional Materials, Ministry of Education, Institute of Materials Physical Chemistry, Huaqiao University", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150f621d"}, {"name": "Jihuai Wu", "org": "Engineering Research Center of Environment-Friendly Functional Materials, Ministry of Education, Institute of Materials Physical Chemistry, Huaqiao University", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fc30f8"}, {"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "Engineering Research Center of Environment-Friendly Functional Materials, Ministry of Education, Institute of Materials Physical Chemistry, Huaqiao University", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e15148cd3"}, {"name": "Jinghao Huo", "org": "Engineering Research Center of Environment-Friendly Functional Materials, Ministry of Education, Institute of Materials Physical Chemistry, Huaqiao University", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fb76fd"}, {"name": "Yongguang Tu", "org": "Engineering Research Center of Environment-Friendly Functional Materials, Ministry of Education, Institute of Materials Physical Chemistry, Huaqiao University", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e1520fa29"}, {"name": "Zhang Lan", "org": "Engineering Research Center of Environment-Friendly Functional Materials, Ministry of Education, Institute of Materials Physical Chemistry, Huaqiao University", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150fed40"}], "title": "Petal-like cobalt selenide nanosheets used as counter electrode in high efficient dye-sensitized solar cells", "venue": "Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Electronics", "year": 2015, "abstract": "A petal-like cobalt selenide nanosheets (Co", "pid": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151d8157"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Jinbiao Jia", "org": "Eng.

Methods: A total of 233 subjects were randomly allocated (1:1 ratio) to receive topically administered FAHT cream (n\u00a0=\u00a0117) or placebo (n\u00a0=\u00a0116) once nightly for 8\u00a0weeks. Observed side effects were documented throughout. Results: In the per protocol set (PPS; those subjects who met all requirements of the protocol), the integral therapeutic efficacy rate of FAHT cream on moderate and severe melasma was 68.57\u00a0% (vs. placebo, 0.94\u00a0%), the clinical effective rate of FAHT cream was 74.29\u00a0% (vs. placebo, 0.94\u00a0%), and the instrumental measure efficacy of FAHT cream was 71.43\u00a0% (vs. placebo, 6.60\u00a0%).

We compared serum GRO\u03b2 levels in patients with colorectal cancer, healthy individuals and individuals with non-tumor diseases. Methods: We measured serum GRO\u03b2 levels with enzyme-linked immunosor-bent assay in patients with colorectal cancer (123 preoperative samples and 66 postoperative samples), 88 healthy controls and 125 individuals with other diseases. Serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) were measured in all samples with an immunoluminometric assay. Statistical analyses were performed to determine associations between serum GRO\u03b2 levels and clinical parameters for colorectal cancer. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was analyzed for GRO\u03b2, CEA and CA19-9. Results: The serum GRO\u03b2 levels were much higher in patients with colorectal cancer (median: 96.15 pg/ml) than those in healthy controls (median: 43.28 pg/ml, P < 0.01) and other disease controls (median: 57.30 pg/ml, P < 0.01). Serum GRO\u03b2 levels in colorectal cancer were correlated positively with tumor-node-metastasis staging (P < 0.01) and the depth of infiltration (P < 0.05), but not with the histological grade, tumor embolus, lymph node metastasis, gross pathologic tumor type, or patient gender. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay for serum GRO\u03b2 were 56.1% (69/123) and 95.31% (203/213), respectively. The area under the ROC curve constructed with GRO\u03b2 (0.834) was larger than that constructed with CEA (0.739) or CA19-9 (0.676) for discriminating colorectal cancer from matched controls.

Experimental results show that maximum recovery efficiencies of P and K reached 99% and 33%, respectively, when the precipitation process was initiated only through adding dissolvable Mg compound source. pH level and molar ratio of Mg:P were key factors determining the nutrient recovery efficiencies. Precipitation equilibrium of MPP and magnesium sodium phosphate heptahydrate (MSP) was confirmed via precipitates analysis using a Scanning Electron Microscope/Energy Dispersive Spectrometer and an X-ray Diffractometer. Then, the standard solubility products of MPP and MSP in the synthetic urine were estimated to be 10<sup>-12.2 \u00b1 0.0.253</sup> and 10<sup>-11.6 \u00b1 0.253</sup>, respectively. The thermodynamic model formulated on chemical software PHREEQC could well fit the experimental results via comparing the simulated and measured concentrations of K and P in equilibrium. Precipitation potentials of three struvite-type compounds were calculated through thermodynamic modeling. Magnesium ammonium phosphate hexahydrate (MAP) has a much higher tendency to precipitate than MPP and MSP in normal urine while MSP was the main inhibitor of MPP in ammonium-removed urine. To optimize the K recovery, ammonium should be removed prior as much as possible and an alternative alkaline compound should be explored for pH adjustment rather than NaOH.", "pid": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e15143e85"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Jianguo Lu", "org": "National and Local United Engineering Lab for Freshwater Fish Breeding", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150ab063"}, {"name": "Min Zheng", "org": "Department of Civil Engineering, Auburn University", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f5d5bc"}, {"name": "Jiajia Zheng", "org": "Heilongjiang River Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e1500d5b9"}, {"name": "Jian Liu", "org": "School of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1512ea74"}, {"name": "Yongzhuang Liu", "org": "School of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e152112f0"}, {"name": "Lina Peng", "org": "Harbin Normal University", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150ae8db"}, {"name": "Pingping Wang", "org": "Heilongjiang River Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fee585"}, {"name": "Xiaofeng Zhang", "org": "Heilongjiang River Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e1500545e"}, {"name": "Qiushi Wang", "org": "Heilongjiang River Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1512a9c8"}, {"name": "Peixian Luan", "org": "Heilongjiang River Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150f2992"}, {"name": "Shahid Mahbooband", "org": "Department of Zoology, College of Science, King Saud University", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151db80e"}, {"name": "Xiaowen Sun", "org": "Heilongjiang River Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150d77e4"}], "title": "Transcriptomic Analyses Reveal Novel Genes with Sexually Dimorphic Expression in Yellow Catfish (Pelteobagrus fulvidraco) Brain", "keywords": ["RNA-Seq", "Sexually dimorphic", "Transcriptome", "Yellow catfish"], "venue": "Marine Biotechnology", "year": 2015, "abstract": "Yellow catfish (Pelteobagrus fulvidraco) is a pivotal freshwater aquaculture species in China. It shows sexual size dimorphism favoring male in growth. Whole transcriptome approach is required to get the overview of genetic toolkit for understanding the sex determination mechanism aiming at devising its monosex production. Beside gonads, the brain is also considered as a major organ for vertebrate reproduction. Transcriptomic analyses on the brain and of different developmental stages will provide the dynamic view necessary for better understanding its sex determination. In this regard, we have performed a de novo assembly of yellow catfish brain transcriptome by high throughput Illumina sequencing. A total number of 154,507 contigs were obtained with the lengths ranging from 201 to 27,822\u00a0bp and N50 of 2,101\u00a0bp, as well as 20,699 unigenes were identified. Of these unigenes, 13 and 54 unigenes were detected to be XY-specifically expressed genes (SEGs) for one and 2-year-old yellow catfish, while the corresponding numbers of XX-SEGs for those two stages were 19 and 13, respectively. Our work identifies a set of annotated genes that are candidate factors affecting sexual dimorphism as well as simple sequence repeat (SSR) and single nucleotide variation (SNV) in yellow catfish. To validate the expression patterns of the sex-related genes, we performed quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) indicating the reliability and accuracy of our analysis. The results in our study may enhance our understanding of yellow catfish sex determination and potentially help to improve the production of all-male yellow catfish for aquaculture.", "pid": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151a69a1"}]}
