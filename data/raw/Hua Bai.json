Lycium barbarum polysaccharides (LBPs) have shown effective antioxidative and immunomodulatory functions in different models. The purpose of the present study was to assess the effects and potential mechanisms of LBPs in intestinal IRI. Several free radical-generating and lipid peroxidation models were used to assess the antioxidant activities of LBPs in vitro. A common IRI model was used to induce intestinal injury by clamping and unclamping the superior mesenteric artery in rats. Changes in the malondialdehyde (MDA), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, activated nuclear factor (NF)- \u03baB, intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, E-selectin, and related antioxidant enzyme levels, polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) accumulation, intestinal permeability, and intestinal histology were examined. We found that LBPs exhibited marked inhibitory action against free radicals and lipid peroxidation in vitro. LBPs increased the levels of antioxidant enzymes and reduced intestinal oxidative injury in animal models of intestinal IRI. In addition, LBPs inhibited PMN accumulation and ICAM-1 expression and ameliorated changes in the TNF-\u03b1 level, NF-\u03baB activation, intestinal permeability, and histology. Our results indicate that LBPs treatment may protect against IRI-induced intestinal damage, possibly by inhibiting IRIinduced oxidative stress and inflammation. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

T cells participate in the pathogenesis of intestinal IRI, and T-cell depletion has been shown to inhibit inflammatory responses and diminish intestinal damage. However, the mechanism by which T cells contribute to intestinal IRI is not completely understood. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a specific subset of T cells that suppress immune responses and protect against tissue injuries. We hypothesized that Tregs might be involved in intestinal IRI. Materials and methods: We subjected C57/Bl6 mice to 30 min of ischemia by clamping the superior mesenteric artery followed by reperfusion. Animals were pretreated with the anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody or adoptive transfer of Tregs before induction of IRI. The number of inflammatory cells, the level of inflammatory factors, and intestinal permeability were assessed. Results: Partial depletion of Tregs with an anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody potentiated intestinal permeability induced by IRI.

The experimental results indicated that when calcined at 400 \u2103 for 30 minutes under atmospheric pressure, aragonite in pearl powder partly transformed into calcite, while aragonite in shell powder completely transformed into calcite. At the same time, the difference in phase transition between the pearl powders and shell powders can be easily detected by using the microscopic infrared reflectance spectroscopy. Therefore, based on the difference in their phase transition process, infrared reflectance spectroscopy can be used to identify phase transformation differences between pearl powder and shell powder.

Methods Patients with stage III non-squamous NSCLC whose EGFR mutation status had been identified were retrospectively analyzed. The response of 87 patients to combined chemoradiotherapy, the two-year survival rate, and the response of 128 patients to initial chemotherapy were evaluated. Results The response rate to combined chemoradiotherapy was 84.6% (33/39) in EGFR mutation-positive patients, significantly higher than the 56.3% (27/48) response rate in EGFR mutation- negative patients (P=0.004).

Methods EBCT angiography with 3-D reconstruction was achieved in 150 patients (142 men and 8 women, mean age, 57 \u00b1 8 years) with 399 grafts including 100 internal mammary artery grafts (IMG), 296 saphenous vein grafts(SVG) and 3 radial artery grafts (RAG) respectively. The time from bypass surgery to EBCT scanning ranged from 7 days to 120 months, averaging 15\u00b128 months. Enhanced single slice mode (SSM) and flow studies were performed in all patients. The results of 3-D reconstruction of CABG were compared with bypass operation records and with coronary arteriograms (7 patients). Results 150 patients underwent successfully EBCT angiography and CABG 3-D reconstruction. According to 3-D reconstruction of the coronary bypass grafts with flow studies, 318 of 399 coronary bypass grafts were patent including IMG patency in 87/100 (87%), SVG in 228/296 (77%) and RAG in 3/3 (100/100).

This study compared the image quality obtained with different scanning and reconstruction parameters for electron-beam computed tomographic (CT) angiography and sought optimal methods for visualizing the coronary artery lumen. Materials and Methods. Electron-beam CT angiography with contrast material enhancement was used to image 35 branches of fresh postmortem swine coronary arteries. Different collimation widths, fields of view (FOVs), reconstruction kernels, and algorithms were employed to reconstruct the acquired raw data into CT angiographic images. Image quality was compared and analyzed. Results. The contrast-to-noise ratios (C/Ns) for 1.5-, 2-, and 3-mm section thickness were 28.4 \u00b1 15.2, 31.9 \u00b1 9.3, and 33.8 \u00b1 14.5, respectively (P < .05).

The highest C/N (48.2 \u00b1 13.3) was achieved with smooth kernels and a cone-beam algorithm, and the lowest (14.7 \u00b1 3.4) with very sharp kernels and a normal algorithm. Cone-beam algorithm images had significantly higher C/Ns than did normal algorithm images (P < .001), and they demonstrated longer coronary artery lumina (P < .01). Conclusion.

The authors performed this study to evaluate the effect of window level and gray-scale threshold on the demonstration of coronary artery lumina at three-dimensional electron-beam computed tomographic (CT) angiography. Materials and Methods. Forty-four coronary artery branches in postmortem pigs were evaluated with electron-beam CT angiography, and the findings were compared with those from conventional angiography. Images from electron-beam CT angiography were reconstructed with maximal intensity projection (MIP), multiplanar reformation (MPR), and shaded-surface display (SSD). Four categories of window level and gray-scale threshold were evaluated. Results. Three-dimensional electron-beam CT angiography accurately depicted the luminal diameters of the coronary arteries compared with conventional angiography (r = 0.83-0.90, P < .0001). The length of lumina visualized at electron-beam CT angiography was significantly shorter than that visualized with conventional angiography (P < .001). The use of MPR enabled visualization of longer segments of coronary arteries than did the use of MIP or SSD (P < .05). The higher the window level and gray-scale threshold used, the smaller the coronary luminal diameters measured (P < .05). The most accurate window level and gray-scale threshold (82.6 HU \u00b1 29.8 and 89.5 HU \u00b1 29.7, respectively) were found to correspond to the attenuation of the lumina (275.8 HU \u00b1 58.8).

The authors performed this study to (a) investigate coronary movement with electron-beam computed tomography (CT) and (b) find the optimal electrocardiographic (ECG) triggering phase for eliminating motion artifact. Materials and Methods. One hundred fifty-one patients without arrhythmia were examined with electron-beam CT. First, movie scans were obtained to create displacement and velocity graphs of coronary artery movement. Then, a volume scan with an exposure time of 100 msec was obtained with various ECG trigger settings. Results. Movement patterns of coronary arteries varied with heart rate. Optimal triggering phase was before atrial systole (near 71% of the R-R interval) when heart rate was slower than 68 beats per minute and at ventricular end systole when heart rate was fast. Rate of severe motion artifacts decreased from 43% to 0% when triggering was altered from 80% of the R-R interval to the individual optimal value. Experimental values of the optimal phase at different heart rates were derived, and severe motion artifact was only 3.0% with these values. Conclusion. ECG triggering set according to the heart rate enables a great reduction in motion artifacts at electron-beam CT with a 100-msec exposure time. The results may have implications for magnetic resonance imaging of the coronary artery.", "pid": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e15080aa5"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Bin Lu", "org": "Harbor-UCLA Research", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e150736b9"}, {"name": "Ruping Dai", "org": "Department of Radiology", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15122d61"}, {"name": "Baolian Jing", "org": "Department of Radiology", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e15159eb3"}, {"name": "Hua Bai", "org": "Department of Radiology", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e151401f8"}, {"name": "Sha He", "org": "Department of Radiology", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151db604"}, {"name": "Nan Zhuang", "org": "Department of Radiology", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1519447b"}, {"name": "Qingyu Wu", "org": "Dept. of Cardiac and Vasc.

The frequency and timing of p16 hypermethylation during the multistep gastric carcinogenesis in Wistar rats were analyzed in various microdissected gastric lesions. The p16 methylation status and the presence of p16 protein were analyzed by methylation-specific PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Results showed that p16 methylation frequency was correlated with the severity of gastric pathologic lesions, positively. For instance, p16 methylation was found in 2.7% of normal gastric epithelium (n=36), 16.7% of chronic atrophy gastritis (n=24), 37.5% of dysplasia (n=24), 67.4% of gastric adenoma (n=43), and 85.2% of gastric carcinoma (n=27). The p16 methylation in the distal stomach epithelium was higher than that in the proximal stomach. p16 protein was expressed in all of 15 p16 unmethylated gastric epithelial samples, but not expressed in all of 12 p16 methylated samples. These results suggest that CpG island hypermethylation may account for the silencing of p16 in rat stomach and is an early event whose accumulation will finally lead to gastric carcinogenesis. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Methods: A retrosp ective study was performed during a period of time from January 2002 to September 2004. Twenty-three patients with aortic IMH were scanned by EBCT more than 2 times. The patients were followed-up for 4-405 days (mean 105.8 days). Mean follow-up was 105.84 days. In this group of 23 patients (19 men and 4 women, aged from 30 to 81 years, mean 57.78 years) who had been undergone EBCT were diagnosed with IMH. EBCT scanner was used with a model of Imatron C-150XP. Contrast-enhanced continuous volume scanning (CVS) was performed. The slice thickness was 6 mm or 3 mm with an acquisition time of 100 milliseconds. A total amount of contrast media (Ultravist 300 or 320, or Ominpaque 300 or 320 mg/ml) of 80-100 ml was used with the rate of 3.5-4.5 ml/s. The scan delayed time was 18-30 s. Results: Four patients with Standford A IMH were diagnosed. Among them, 3 patients were observed complete regression, 1 patient was observed without changing. Nineteen patients with Standford B IMH were diagnosed.

The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between p16 methylation and malignant transformation of human gastric dysplasia (DYS) based on follow-up endoscopic screening in a high-risk population. Experimental Design: Genomic DNA samples were extracted from paraffin blocks of gastric mucosal biopsies that were histopathologically diagnosed as low-grade DYS from patients who developed gastric carcinomas [GCs (n = 21)] and those that did not do so (n = 21) during 5 years of follow-up. The methylation status of p16 CpG islands of each sample was detected by methylation-specific PCR, denatured high-performance liquid chromatography, and sequencing. Results: Aberrant p16 methylation was observed in 5 of 21 samples of DYS that progressed to GC but in 0 of 21 samples that did not progress to GC (P = 0.048, two-sided). Sequencing results confirmed that all CpG sites were methylated in the analyzed sequence from these five p16-methylated cases. Furthermore, p16 methylation was also observed in the five subsequent GCs. Unmethylated p16 CpG islands were detected in all of the samples without p16 methylation.

The aim of this study was to detect the expression pattern of \u0394DNMT3B variants in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and to explore the role of \u0394DNMT3B variants in regulating the promoter-specific DNA methylation. Methods: Specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primer sets were designed to distinguish individual \u0394DNMT3B variants according to their splicing patterns. The expressions of seven \u0394DNMT3B variants were measured in 13 cell lines, 109 NSCLC patients, and the corresponding normal lung tissues using reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR).

Methods: A total of 44 treatment-naive patients of advanced NSCLC with positive cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression confirmed by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining were designed to receive celecoxib plus platinum-doublet chemotherapy (cisplatin plus gemcitabine, novelbine or docetaxol) from February 2005 to May 2007. On 5-7 day before chemotherapy, 400 mg celecoxib was administered twice a day orally until obvious evidence of disease progression or intolerable toxicity was found. Adverse events were recorded according to NCI-CTC criteria. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). The secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), 1-year survival rate, response rate (RR) and safety. Additionally, we detected epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) status including EGFR gene amplification by real-time PCR and gene mutations by DHPLC followed by sequencing. Results: The response rate was 45% (20/44), and the disease control rate (DCR) was 59% (26/44). The median progression-free survival time and median survival time were 6 m and 18 m, respectively. The 1-year survival rate was 68%. Chemotherapy cycle numbers and best response were found to be the predictive factors for PFS by COX model analysis (P = 0.023 and P = 0.000, respectively). No factor was found to affect OS. The most common toxicities included neutropenia and nausea/vomit. EGFR gene amplification was an independent prognostic factor influencing OS (P = 0.0002). Patients with EGFR mutations (exon 21) had a tendency of disease progression (P = 0.041). Conclusion: Encouraging activities of celecoxib combined with platinum-doublet chemotherapy were demonstrated in treatment-naive patients with advanced NSCLC, with good tolerances.

However, obtaining tumor tissues for mutation analysis is challenging. We hypothesized that plasma-based EGFR mutation analysis is feasible and has value in predicting tumor response in patients with NSCLC. Patients and Methods: Plasma DNA samples and matched tumors from 230 patients with stages IIIB to IV NSCLC were analyzed for EGFR mutations in exons 19 and 21 by using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography. We compared the mutations in the plasma samples and the matched tumors and determined an association between EGFR mutation status and the patients' clinical outcomes prospectively. Results: In 230 patients, we detected 81 EGFR mutations in 79 (34.3%) of the patients' plasma samples. We detected the same mutations in 63 (79.7%) of the matched tumors. Sixteen plasma (7.0%) and fourteen tumor (6.1%) samples showed unique mutations. The mutation frequencies were significantly higher in never-smokers and in patients with adenocarcinomas (P = .012 and P = .009, respectively). In the 102 patients who failed platinum-based treatment and who were treated with gefitinib, 22 (59.5%) of the 37 with EGFR mutations in the plasma samples, whereas only 15 (23.1%) of the 65 without EGFR mutations, achieved an objective response (P = .002).

While \u0394DNMT3B7 is associated with progestogen receptor. No relation between the \u0394DNMT3B variants and the patients' survival were found. \u00a9 Chinese Anti-Cancer Association and Springer-Verlag GmbH 2009.", "pid": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e15181460"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Zhijie Wang", "org": "Department of Thoracic Oncology", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1508e6ab"}, {"name": "Lu Yang", "org": "Department of Thoracic Oncology", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151e699a"}, {"name": "Tongtong An", "org": "Department of Thoracic Oncology", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1515ce75"}, {"name": "Jun Zhao", "org": "Department of Thoracic Oncology", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150dd93d"}, {"name": "Hua Bai", "org": "Department of Thoracic Oncology", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e151401f8"}, {"name": "Jianchun Duan", "org": "Department of Thoracic Oncology", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f9a282"}, {"name": "Meina Wu", "org": "Department of Thoracic Oncology", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1517a427"}, {"name": "Minglei Zhuo", "org": "Department of Thoracic Oncology", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150cb6e7"}, {"name": "Yuyan Wang", "org": "Department of Thoracic Oncology", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15011d14"}, {"name": "Jie Wang", "org": "Department of Thoracic Oncology", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fa7cc4"}], "title": "The association between EGFR gene amplification and the prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer: A meta-analysis", "keywords": ["Epidermal growth factor receptor", "Lung neoplasms", "Meta analysis", "Prognosis"], "venue": "Chinese Journal of Lung Cancer", "year": 2009, "abstract": "Background and objective: Many studies concluded that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene amplification might be related with the prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer. However, the results were not consistent. To identify whether EGFR gene amplification could affect the prognosis, a meta-analysis was conducted based on the published works. Methods: According to inclusion and exclusion criteria, articles were selected from medical electronic databases searching, including PubMed, Cochrane library and CNKI. Te qualities of included articles were scored based on the European Lung Cancer Working Party scale, and the hazard ratio (HR) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) were also collected. Meta-analysis was completed using software Review Manager 4.2. Results: Forest plot from 12 studies in which 1 221 included patients were all treated with EGFR-TKI showed that the prognosis of patients harboring EGFR gene amplification were superior to negative ones (HR=0.82, 95%CI: 0.68-0.99, P=0.04), and for Caucasian patients who received EGFR-TKI, the survivals were longer in EGFR gene amplification positive cases than those without amplification (HR=0.42, 95%CI: 0.31-0.57, P<0.001). Meta results from 8 studies in which 658 included patients did not receive EGFR-TKI indicated that the casualty hazard of amplification positive patients was comparable with negative ones. However, for Asia patients who failed to receive EGFR-TKI, the prognosis of patients with EGFR gene amplification were inferior to negative ones (HR=1.88, 95%CI: 1.21-2.93, P=0.005).

EGFR genotypes of 145 chemotherapy-naive patients with Stage IIIB and IV NSCLC were examined by using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC). All patients received the front-line chemotherapy. There were 69 patients who received gefitinib therapy (32 as second-line and 37 as third-line therapy). About 37.9% (55/145) of the patients was detected to have EGFR mutations in their tumor tissue DNA.

This study aims to evaluate a plasma-based KRAS mutation analysis and the clinical significance of plasma KRAS mutation as a predictive marker for tumor resistance to EGFR-TKIs in patients with NSCLC. Experimental Design: DNA extracted from plasma and matched tumor tissues were obtained from 273 patients with advanced stage NSCLC. Patients were followed up prospectively for treatment outcomes. KRAS mutations in codon 12 and 13 were detected using PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Mutations in plasma and matched tumors were compared. Associations between KRAS mutation status and patients' clinical outcomes were analyzed. Results: KRAS mutation was found in 35 (12.8%) plasma samples and 30 (11.0%) matched tumor tissues. The consistency of KRAS mutations between plasma and tumors is 76.7% (23 of 30; \u03ba = 0.668; P < 0.001). Among 120 patients who received EGFR-TKI treatment, the response rate was only 5.3% (1 of 19) for patients with plasma KRAS mutation compared with 29.7% for patients with no KRAS mutation in plasma DNA (P = 0.024). The median progression-free survival time of patients with plasma KRAS mutation was 2.5 months compared with 8.8 months for patients with wild-type KRAS (P < 0.001). Conclusions: KRAS mutation in plasma DNA correlates with the mutation status in the matched tumor tissues of patients with NSCLC. Plasma KRAS mutation status is associated with a poor tumor response to EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC patients and may be used as a predictive marker in selecting patients for such treatment. \u00a92010 AACR.", "pid": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e151072fe"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Lu Yang", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151e699a"}, {"name": "Zhi-Jie Wang", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1508e6ab"}, {"name": "Tong-Tong An", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1515ce75"}, {"name": "Hua Bai", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e151401f8"}, {"name": "Jun Zhao", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150dd93d"}, {"name": "Jian-Chun Duan", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f9a282"}, {"name": "Ping-Ping Li", "org": "Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine Combined West Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15029d8f"}, {"name": "Mei-Na Wu", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1517a427"}, {"name": "Hong Sun", "org": "Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine Combined West Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150b3cc8"}, {"name": "Li Liang", "org": "Department of Oncology", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150a655a"}, {"name": "Jie Wang", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fa7cc4"}], "title": "A phase II trial of gefitinib as maintenance therapy after first-line chemotherapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer in China", "keywords": ["Gefitinib", "Maintenance therapy", "Non-small cell lung cancer"], "venue": "Chinese Journal of Cancer Research", "year": 2010, "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the efficacy and safety of gefitinib as maintenance therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who obtained disease control (DC) after first-line chemotherapy in Chinese population. Methods: Chinese patients with advanced NSCLC treated with standard chemotherapy and obtained DC were assigned to receive gefitinib as maintenance treatment. The primary end point was overall survival time (OS), the second end point was disease control rate (DCR) and progression-free survival time (PFS). DCR included complete response (CR) plus partial response (PR) and plus stable disease (SD). The impact of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status on the treatment as exploratory point was also evaluated by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC). Results: Among 75 enrolled patients, the overall response rate was 37% and the DCR (CR + PR +SD) was 66%. The median PFS and OS were 17.13 months and 26.13 months respectively, with 1- and 2-year survival rates 89.3% and 34.7%.

Its pharmacological activities have been the focus of intense research in recent years. However, there is little research on the antioxidant activities of OA. In the present study, we aim to investigate whether OA produces its protective effects mainly through antioxidant mechanisms and whether OA plays as an antioxidant through quenching reactive oxygen species (ROS), inhibiting lipid peroxidation or stimulating cellular antioxidant defenses. In the in vitro antioxidant activity-assessing models, OA acted as not only a free radical-scavenger through direct chemical reactions but also a biological molecule, which may enhance the antioxidant defenses. tert-Butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP) induced ROS generation, damaged plasma membrane and decreased cell viability and the expression of key antioxidant enzymes and MAP kinases in QZG cells. OA ameliorated the oxidative injury induced by tBHP through increasing the generation of antioxidant (glutathione) and the expression of key antioxidant enzymes mediated by nuclear factorerythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2), in which process, activation of JNK and ERK, but not p38, was involved. The present study, for the first time, investigated the antioxidant activities of OA systematically. OA probably functions mainly through indirect biological effect and protects QZG cells against cytotoxicity induced by tBHP through increasing the generation of antioxidant and the expression of oxidative stress sensitive transcription factor-Nrf2, and MAP kinases, mainly JNK and ERK. These findings may significantly better the understanding of OA and advance therapeutic approaches to the diseases which are associated with oxidative stress. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.", "pid": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151ac630"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Lin Ji", "org": "Department of Toxicology", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15128eff"}, {"name": "Rui Liu", "org": "Department of Toxicology", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e15183891"}, {"name": "Xiao Di Zhang", "org": "Department of Toxicology", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e15132250"}, {"name": "Hong Li Chen", "org": "Department of Toxicology", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f56ece"}, {"name": "Hua Bai", "org": "Department of Toxicology", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e151401f8"}, {"name": "Xin Wang", "org": "Department of Toxicology", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1508793f"}, {"name": "Hai Long Zhao", "org": "Department of Toxicology", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f52f00"}, {"name": "Xin Liang", "org": "Department of Toxicology", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e15189f04"}, {"name": "Chun Xu Hai", "org": "Department of Toxicology", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1515837d"}], "title": "N-acetylcysteine attenuates phosgene-induced acute lung injury via up-regulation of Nrf2 expression", "keywords": ["Acute lung injury", "Glutathione", "N-acetylcysteine", "Nrf2", "Phosgene"], "venue": "Inhalation Toxicology", "year": 2010, "abstract": "Previous studies indicated that oxidative stress was involved in phosgene-induced acute lung injury (ALI) and many antioxidants had been used to prevent ALI. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) had been used to protect ALI induced by various types of oxidative stress. Considering the limited information of NAC on phosgene-induced ALI, the purpose of this study was to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of phosgene-induced ALI and the protective effects of NAC. This study discovered that intraperitoneal administration of NAC significantly alleviated phosgene-induced pulmonary edema, as confirmed by decreased lung wet to dry weight ratio and oxidative stress markers. The content of l-\u03b3-glutamyl-l- cysteinyl-glycine (glutathione; GSH) and the ratio of the reduced and disulfide forms (GSH/GSSG), significant indicators of the antioxidative ability, were apparently inhibited by phosgene exposure. However, both indicators could be reversed by NAC administration, indicating that dysregulation of redox status of glutathione might be the cause of phosgene-induced ALI. The nuclear factor (NF)-E2related factor 2 (Nrf2), which has been proven to up-regulate the expression of glutathione reductase (GR), was obviously decreased by phosgene exposure. However, NAC administration elevated Nrf2 expression significantly. In conclusion, these data provided the first evidences showing that it was the transcriptional factor Nrf2 that connected phosgene-induced ALI with GSH metabolism. NAC protected against oxidative stress through acting on this newly disclosed Nrf2/GR/GSH pathway, by which NAC elevated the biosynthesis of protective GSH to repair and reconstitute the defense system destroyed by phosgene. \u00a9 2010 Informa UK Ltd.", "pid": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1506af22"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Xin Wang", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1508793f"}, {"name": "Jun Zhao", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150dd93d"}, {"name": "Lu Yang", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151e699a"}, {"name": "Li Mao", "org": "Department of Thoracic/Head and Neck Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433e3e1cd8e4e15f3fc94"}, {"name": "Tongtong An", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1515ce75"}, {"name": "Hua Bai", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e151401f8"}, {"name": "Suhang Wang", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e1501402c"}, {"name": "Xuyi Liu", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e150213b7"}, {"name": "Guoshuang Feng", "org": "Department of Biostatistics", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15facfa0"}, {"name": "Jie Wang", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fa7cc4"}], "title": "Positive expression of ERCC1 predicts a poorer platinum-based treatment outcome in Chinese patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer", "keywords": ["ERCC1", "NSCLC", "Platinum-based chemotherapy", "RRM1"], "venue": "Medical Oncology", "year": 2010, "abstract": "The goal of this study is to determine role of excision repair cross-complementing group 1 gene (ERCC1) and ribonucleotide reductase subunit M1 (RRM1) expression in predicting response and survival in Chinese patients with advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded biopsy tissues were retrospectively obtained from 124 advanced NSCLC patients. Protein expression levels of ERCC1 and RRM1 were determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Associations between expression of ERCC1 and RRM1 and clinic-pathologic parameters were analyzed. The study shows that ERCC1 and RRM1 expression was detected in 43 (35%) and 50 (40%) of the 124 tumor samples, respectively. Expression of ERCC1 and RRM1 was negatively associated with tumor response. Fifty-four percent patients whose tumors did not express ERCC1 had partial response (PR) compared to 33% whose tumors expressed the protein (P = 0.022). Similarly, 54% patients whose tumor did not express RRM1 had PR compared to 36% whose tumors expression the protein (P = 0.042). Further, patients whose tumors lacked of ERCC1 but not RRM1 expression had a longer median survival time than those tumors expressed ERCC1 (13.4 months versus 9.1 months; P = 0.006), which is independent of other prognostic factors (P = 0.0066). In conclusion, tumor ERCC1 expression is associated with tumor response and patients' survival in Chinese advanced NSCLC patients treated with platinum-based regimen and may serve as a biomarker in predicting tumor response and clinical outcome in the patient population. \u00a9 2009 Humana Press Inc.", "pid": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e151039d0"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Hua Bai", "org": "Department of Toxicology, Faculty of Preventive Medicine", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e151401f8"}, {"name": "Chunxu Hai", "org": "Department of Toxicology, Faculty of Preventive Medicine", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1515837d"}, {"name": "Miaomiao Xi", "org": "Department of Pharmacy, Xijing Hospital", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15ff1f25"}, {"name": "Xin Liang", "org": "Department of Toxicology, Faculty of Preventive Medicine", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e15189f04"}, {"name": "Rui Liu", "org": "Department of Toxicology, Faculty of Preventive Medicine", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e15183891"}], "title": "Protective Effect of Maize Silks (Maydis stigma) Ethanol Extract on Radiation-Induced Oxidative Stress in Mice", "keywords": ["Antioxidant enzyme", "Maize silks ethanol extract", "NF-E2-related factor-2", "Oxidative stress", "Radiation"], "venue": "Plant Foods for Human Nutrition", "year": 2010, "abstract": "Maize silks, dried cut stigmata of maize female flowers, are a traditional medicinal plant.

Palmitic acid (PA) is the most prevalent saturated FFA in circulation. However, the mechanism underlying the effect of PA on cell proliferation is still to be elucidated. In this report, we, for the first time, investigate the signaling pathway in human normal hepatocytes (QZG) responsible for PA-induced proliferation. The results demonstrate that PA promotes cell cycle progression, accelerates cell proliferation, and induces a transient and sequential activation of a series of kinases. The employment of several inhibitors and antioxidants indicates that a ROS-induced stress-sensitive p38 MAPK/ERK-Akt cascade plays a critical role in the regulation of PA on cell cycle and cell proliferation. Moreover, PA dose and time dependently activates Nrf2 and this activation relies on ROS-induced stimulation of p38 MAPK/ERK-Akt signaling, demonstrating that Nrf2 activation may be associated with the regulation of PA on cell cycle transition and proliferation. In conclusion, our study elucidates the importance of PA metabolism on cell proliferation, and suggests that PA stimulates hepatocyte proliferation through activating the ROS-p38 MAPK/ERK-Akt cascade which is intersected with the activation of Nrf2 and that the effect of ROS on signal transduction is in a dose- and time-dependent manner. All the above noted provide a new clue for the central role of ROS in cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Inc.", "pid": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150a77a0"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Zhi-Jie Wang", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1508e6ab"}, {"name": "Tong-Tong An", "org": "Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1515ce75"}, {"name": "Tony Mok", "org": "Department of Clinical Oncology", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fe6069"}, {"name": "Lu Yang", "org": "Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151e699a"}, {"name": "Hua Bai", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e151401f8"}, {"name": "Jun Zhao", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150f643f"}, {"name": "Jian-Chun Duan", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f9a282"}, {"name": "Mei-Na Wu", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1517a427"}, {"name": "Yu-Yan Wang", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15011d14"}, {"name": "Ping-Ping Li", "org": "Department of Integrative Medicine", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15029d8f"}, {"name": "Hong Sun", "org": "Department of Integrative Medicine", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150b3cc8"}, {"name": "Ping Yang", "org": "Department of Oncology", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e15044fb3"}, {"name": "Jie Wang", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fa7cc4"}], "title": "Immediate versus delayed treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors after first-line therapy in advanced mon-small-cell lung cancer", "keywords": ["EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor", "Maintenance therapy", "Non-small-cell lung cancer"], "venue": "Chinese Journal of Cancer Research", "year": 2011, "abstract": "Objective: To analyze the outcomes of patients who received TKI immediately after the first-line without progression as maintenance treatment (immediate group) vs. those received delayed treatment upon disease progression as second-line therapy (delayed group).

In a subgroup analysis that included only patients with EGFR mutation however PFS was significantly longer in the immediate group than in the delayed group (HR 0.48*95% CI: 0.27-0.85*P=0.012). In patients with wild type EGFR the risk for disease progression was comparable between the two groups (HR 1.23*95% CI: 0.61-2.51*P=0.564).

The protective effect of rosiglitazone is involved in its regulation on the function of PPAR\u03b3. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier GmbH.", "pid": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151cc617"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Ming-Lei Zhuo", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150cb6e7"}, {"name": "Mei-Na Wu", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1517a427"}, {"name": "Jun Zhao", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150f643f"}, {"name": "Sonya Wei Song", "org": "Laboratory of Oncology", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e15133d4c"}, {"name": "Hua Bai", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e151401f8"}, {"name": "Shu-Hang Wang", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1508c016"}, {"name": "Lu Yang", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151e699a"}, {"name": "Tong-Tong An", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1515ce75"}, {"name": "Xin Wang", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1508793f"}, {"name": "Jian-Chun Duan", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f9a282"}, {"name": "Yu-Yan Wang", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15011d14"}, {"name": "Qing-Zhi Guo", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e1520cf13"}, {"name": "Xu-Yi Liu", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e150213b7"}, {"name": "Ning-Hong Liu", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1502bd60"}, {"name": "Jie Wang", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fa7cc4"}], "title": "Epidermal growth factor receptor genotype in plasma DNA and outcome of chemotherapy in the Chinese patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer", "keywords": ["Epidermal growth factor receptor mutation", "First line chemotherapy", "Gefitinib", "Non-small cell lung cancer", "Plasma", "Prognosis", "Targeted therapy"], "venue": "Chinese Medical Journal", "year": 2011, "abstract": "Background The genotype of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is associated with tyrosine kinase inhibitor and effectiveness of therapy, but its role in cytotoxic chemotherapy is still unknown. Previous studies indicated that certain EGFR mutations were associated with response and progression free survival following platinum based chemotherapy. Our recent studies have identified that EGFR genotypes in the tumour tissues were not associated with response to the first-line chemotherapy in Chinese patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In this study, we investigated associations of EGFR genotypes from plasma of patients with advanced NSCLC and response to first-line chemotherapy and prognosis. Methods We enrolled 145 advanced NSCLC patients who had received first-line chemotherapy in our department. We examined plasma EGFR genotypes for these patients and associations of EGFR mutations with response to chemotherapy and clinical outcomes. Results There were 54 patients with known EGFR mutations and 91 cases of wild types. No significant difference was detected in the response rate to first-line chemotherapy between mutation carriers and wild-type patients (37.0% vs. 31.9%). The median survival time and 1-, 2-year survival rates were higher in mutation carriers than wild-types (24 months vs. 18 months, 85.7% vs. 65.7% and 43.7% vs. 25.9%, P=0.047). Clinical stage (IV vs. IIIb), response to the first-line chemotherapy (partial vs. no) and EGFR genotype were independent prognostic factors.

However, at least 10% of patients with EGFR wild-type are responsive to TKIs, suggesting that other determinants of outcome besides EGFR mutation might exist. We hypothesized that activation of phosphorylated EGFR could be a potential predictive biomarker to EGFR-TKIs treatment among patients in wild-type EGFR. Method. Total of 205 stage IIIb and IV NSCLC patients, tissue samples of whom were available for molecular analysis, were enrolled in this study. The phosphorylation of EGFR at tyrosine 1068 (pTyr1068) and 1173 (pTyr1173) were assessed by immunohistochemistry, and EGFR mutations were detected by denaturing high performance liquid chromatograph (DHPLC). Results: Among 205 patients assessable for EGFR mutation and phosphorylation analysis, 92 (44.9%) were EGFR mutant and 165 patients (57.6%) had pTyr1173 expression. Superior progression-free survival (PFS) was seen after EGFR-TKIs therapy in patients with pTyr1068 expression compared to pTyr1068 negative ones (median PFS 7.0 months vs. 1.2 months, P < 0.001). Inversely, patients with pTyr1173 had a shorter PFS (4.8 months VS. 7.7 months, P = 0.016). In subgroup of patients with wild-type EGFR, pTyr1068 expression positive ones had a significantly prolonged PFS (4.2 months vs.1.2 months P < 0.001) compared with those without pTyr1068 expression. Sixteen patients with both wild-type EGFR and pTyr1068 who responded to EGFR-TKIs had median PFS of 15.6 months (95%CI: 7.28-23.9). Conclusion: pTyr1068 may be a predictive biomarker for screening the population for clinical response to EGFR-TKIs treatment; especially for patients with wild-type EGFR. \u00a9 2012 Wang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "pid": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e15042924"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Hua Bai", "org": "Peking University Cancer Hospital and Institute", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e151401f8"}, {"name": "Zhijie Wang", "org": "Peking University Cancer Hospital and Institute", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1508e6ab"}, {"name": "Keneng Chen", "org": "Peking University Cancer Hospital and Institute", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fda70b"}, {"name": "Jun Zhao", "org": "Peking University Cancer Hospital and Institute", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150f643f"}, {"name": "J.

However, it remains unclear whether chemotherapy affects EGFR mutation status in NSCLC. We investigated the influence of chemotherapy on EGFR mutations in plasma and tumor tissues from patients with NSCLC. Patients and Methods: Samples were derived from three cohorts: one, 264 patients with advanced NSCLC who received first-line chemotherapy with matched pre- and postchemotherapy blood samples; two, 63 patients with stages IIb to IIIb disease with pre- and post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy tumor tissues; and three, 79 patients with advanced NSCLC who underwent palliative surgery. EGFR mutation status was determined and analyzed to reveal potential impact of chemotherapy. Results: In the first cohort, EGFR mutations were detected in 34.5% of the prechemotherapy plasma samples (91 of 264) but in only 23.1% of the postchemotherapy plasma samples (61 of 264). The decrease in EGFR mutation rate was statistically significant (P < .001). Patients whose EGFR mutations switched from positive to negative after chemotherapy had a better partial response (PR) than patients with a reverse change (P = .037). A similar decrease in EGFR mutation rate was observed in tissues after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the second cohort (34.9% [22 of 63] v 19.0% [12 of 63]; P = .013). In the third cohort, 38.0% of the tumors (30 of 79) showed an intratumor heterogeneity of EGFR mutation, whereas 62.0% (49 of 79) were homogeneous, either with EGFR mutation or no mutation. Conclusion: Our results suggest that chemotherapy may reduce EGFR mutation frequency in patients with NSCLC, likely the result of a preferential response of subclones with EGFR mutations in tumors with heterogeneous tumor cell populations. \u00a9 2012 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.", "pid": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e15143ab9"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Zhen Huang", "org": "Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education)", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150b77f2"}, {"name": "Zhijie Wang", "org": "Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education)", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1508e6ab"}, {"name": "Hua Bai", "org": "Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education)", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e151401f8"}, {"name": "Meina Wu", "org": "Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education)", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1517a427"}, {"name": "Tongtong An", "org": "Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education)", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1515ce75"}, {"name": "Jun Zhao", "org": "Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education)", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150f643f"}, {"name": "Lu Yang", "org": "Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education)", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151e699a"}, {"name": "Jianchun Duan", "org": "Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education)", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f9a282"}, {"name": "Minglei Zhuo", "org": "Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education)", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150cb6e7"}, {"name": "Yuyan Wang", "org": "Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education)", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15011d14"}, {"name": "Shuhang Wang", "org": "Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education)", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1508c016"}, {"name": "Jie Wang", "org": "Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education)", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fa7cc4"}], "title": "The detection of EGFR mutation status in plasma is reproducible and can dynamically predict the efficacy of EGFR-TKI", "keywords": ["DHPLC", "EGFR mutation", "NSCLC", "Plasma DNA"], "venue": "Thoracic Cancer", "year": 2012, "abstract": "Background: The validity of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation in serum and plasma DNA as a surrogate of tumor tissue has been comprehensively explored. However, the concordance between peripheral blood and tumor tissue samples in EGFR mutation detection remains variable. The question as to whether real-time samples for EGFR mutation analysis are required before epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) therapy remains unanswered. Methods: This study included two cohorts:(i) 822 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with primary tumor tissue and matched plasma samples at initial diagnosis; and (ii) 207 patients with advanced NSCLC who had plasma samples taken immediately before EGFR-TKI therapy, in which 157 cases had matched tumor tissues. Denaturing High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (DHPLC) determined EGFR mutation status. Results: Among a total of 822 patients with matched samples, the EGFR mutation rates were 36.3% and 32.1% in tissue and plasma samples, respectively. Concordance of EGFR mutation between two kinds of samples was 77.0% (631/822),with 63.5% (188/296) of accuracy of EGFR mutation in plasma DNA. In 207 advanced NSCLC patients who had plasma samples taken immediately before EGFR-TKI therapy, the objective response rate (ORR) after EGFR-TKI therapy was significantly higher in EGFR mutant patients than those in EGFR wild-type patients (51.4% vs. 22.6%, P < 0.001), regardless of the treatment lines of EGFR-TKI. In patients with two or more lines of EGFR-TKI therapy, EGFR mutation status in plasma samples, but not in tissues, was a predictor for progression-free survival (PFS) after EGFR-TKI therapy (mutant vs. wild-type: 10.1 months vs. 3.7 months, P = 0.038). Conclusions: An EGFR mutation test using plasma DNA samples was validated and reproducible.

Methods: Patients with stage IV NSCLC were screened for EML4-ALK rearrangement and EGFR mutations at the Peking University Cancer Hospital. EML4-ALK was identified using fluorescent in situ hybridization and confirmed by immunohistochemistry. EGFR mutations were determined using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography. Results: The incidence of EML4-ALK was 9.7% (11/113). Patients with EML4-ALK were more likely to present the EGFR wild type (WT; p = 0.033). Response to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) was similar between patients with EML4-ALK rearrangement and EGFR mutation (33.3 vs. 46.9%, p = 0.451), but progression-free survival (PFS) was inferior compared to those with EGFR mutation (2.1 vs. 8.8 months, p = 0.032), and similar to patients with WT/nonrearrangement (2.1 vs. 2.2 months, p = 0.696; and general p = 0.023 between the three cohorts).

Our results identified the genes peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPARG), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein \u03b2 (CEBPB), ets variant 4 (ETV4), Friend leukemia virus integration 1 (FLI1), T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia 1 (TAL1) and nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells 1 (NFKB1) as hub nodes in the transcriptome network. Among these genes, it appears that: PPARG promotes the PPAR signaling pathway via the upregulation of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) expression, but suppresses the cell cycle pathway via downregulation of growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible, \u03b3 (GADD45G) expression; ETV4 stimulates matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) expression to induce the bladder cancer pathway; FLI upregulates transforming growth factor, \u03b2 receptor II (TGFBR2) expression to activate TGF-\u03b2 signaling and upregulates cyclin D3 (CCND3) expression to promote the cell cycle pathway; NFKB1 upregulates interleukin 1, \u03b2 (IL-1B) expression and initiates the prostate cancer pathway; CEBPB upregulates IL-6 expression and promotes pathways in cancer; and TAL1 promotes kinase insert domain receptor (KDR) expression to promote the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway. This transcriptional regulation analysis may provide an improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of lung AC.", "pid": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f74606"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Jian Zhu", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1508173c"}, {"name": "Yuyan Wang", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15011d14"}, {"name": "Jianchun Duan", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f9a282"}, {"name": "Hua Bai", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e151401f8"}, {"name": "Zhijie Wang", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1508e6ab"}, {"name": "Lai Wei", "org": "Laboratory of Immunology", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f61ac3"}, {"name": "Jun Zhao", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150f643f"}, {"name": "Minglei Zhuo", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150cb6e7"}, {"name": "Shuhang Wang", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1508c016"}, {"name": "Lu Yang", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151e699a"}, {"name": "Tongtong An", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1515ce75"}, {"name": "Meina Wu", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1517a427"}, {"name": "Jie Wang", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fa7cc4"}], "title": "DNA Methylation status of Wnt antagonist SFRP5 can predict the response to the EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy in non-small cell lung cancer", "keywords": ["DNA methylation", "EGFR-TKI", "Non-small cell lung cancer", "Wnt antagonists"], "venue": "Journal of Experimental and Clinical Cancer Research", "year": 2012, "abstract": "Background: It is well known that genetic alternation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays critical roles in tumorgenesis of lung cancer and can predict outcome of non-small-cell lung cancer treatment, especially the EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) therapy. However, it is unclear whether epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation involve in the response to the EGFR-TKI therapy. Methods. Tumor samples from 155 patients with stages IIIB to IV NSCLC who received EGFR-TKI therapy were analyzed for DNA methylation status of Wnt antagonist genes, including SFRP1, SFRP2, SFRP5, DKK3, WIF1, and APC, using methylation specific PCR (MSP) method. EGFR mutations detections were performed in the same tissues samples using Denaturing High Performance Liquid Chromatography (DHPLC). Results: We found that Wnt antagonists tend to methylate simultaneously. Methylation of sFRP1 and sFRP5 are reversely correlated with EGFR mutation (P=0.005, P=0.011). However, no correlations of methylations of other Wnt antagonist genes with EGFR mutation were found. The patients with methylated SFRP5 have a significant shorter progression free survival than those with unmethylated SFRP5 in response to EGFR-TKI treatment (P=0.002), which is independent of EGFR genotype. Conclusions: Patients with unmethylated SFRP5 are more likely to benefit from EGFR-TKI therapy. \u00a9 2012 Zhu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "pid": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f4b163"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Hong-Li Chen", "org": "Department of Toxicology", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f56ece"}, {"name": "Hua Bai", "org": "Department of Toxicology", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e151401f8"}, {"name": "Miao-Miao Xi", "org": "Department of Pharmacy, Xijing Hospital", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15ff1f25"}, {"name": "Riu Liu", "org": "Department of Toxicology", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e15209eb3"}, {"name": "Xu-Jun Qin", "org": "Department of Toxicology", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15023d4a"}, {"name": "Xin Liang", "org": "Department of Toxicology", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e15189f04"}, {"name": "Wei Zhang", "org": "Department of Toxicology", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f4e7de"}, {"name": "Xiao-Di Zhang", "org": "Department of Toxicology", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e15132250"}, {"name": "Wen-Li Li", "org": "Department of Toxicology", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f883d5"}, {"name": "Chun-Xu Hai", "org": "Department of Toxicology", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1515837d"}], "title": "Ethyl pyruvate protects rats from phosgene-induced pulmonary edema by inhibiting cyclooxygenase2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase expression", "keywords": ["Cyclooxygenase2", "Ethyl pyruvate", "Inducible nitric oxide synthas", "Mitogen-activated protein kinases", "Phosgene", "Pulmonary edema"], "venue": "Journal of Applied Toxicology", "year": 2013, "abstract": "Phosgene is a poorly water-soluble gas penetrating the lower respiratory tract which can induce acute lung injury characterized by a latent phase of fatal pulmonary edema.

Previous study indicated that oxidative stress was involved in phosgene-induced ALI.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the protective effects of CAPE on phosgene-induced ALI and identify the mechanism, in which oxidative stress and inflammation were involved. The phosgene was used to induce ALI in rats. The results showed that after phosgene exposure, total protein content in BALF was not significantly changed. The increase of MDA level and SOD activity induced by phosgene was significantly reduced by CAPE administration, and the decrease of GSH level in BALF and lung were significantly reversed by CAPE. CAPE also partially blocked the translocation of NF-\u03baB p65 to the nucleus, but it had little effect on the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. In conclusion, CAPE showed protective effects on lung against phosgene-induced ALI, which may be related with a combination of the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory functions of CAPE. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier GmbH.", "pid": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f7d949"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Hua Bai", "org": "Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education)", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e151401f8"}, {"name": "Zhijie Wang", "org": "Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education)", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1508e6ab"}, {"name": "Yuyan Wang", "org": "Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education)", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15011d14"}, {"name": "Minglei Zhuo", "org": "Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education)", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150cb6e7"}, {"name": "Qinghua Zhou", "org": "Department of Thoracic Surgery", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150b04d4"}, {"name": "Jianchun Duan", "org": "Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education)", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f9a282"}, {"name": "Lu Yang", "org": "Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education)", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151e699a"}, {"name": "Meina Wu", "org": "Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education)", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1517a427"}, {"name": "Tongtong An", "org": "Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education)", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1515ce75"}, {"name": "Jun Zhao", "org": "Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education)", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150f643f"}, {"name": "Jie Wang", "org": "Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education)", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fa7cc4"}], "title": "Detection and Clinical Significance of Intratumoral EGFR Mutational Heterogeneity in Chinese Patients with Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "year": 2013, "abstract": "Purpose: This study evaluated occurrence and potential clinical significance of intratumoral EGFR mutational heterogeneity in Chinese patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Materials and Methods: Eighty-five stage IIIa-IV NSCLC patients who had undergone palliative surgical resection were included in this study. Of these, 45 patients carried EGFR mutations (group-M) and 40 patients were wild-type (group-W). Each tumor sample was microdissected to yield 28-34 tumor foci and Intratumoral EGFR mutation were determined using Denaturing High Performance Liquid Chromatography (DHPLC) and Amplification Refractory Mutation System (ARMS). EGFR copy numbers were measured using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Results: Microdissection yielded 1,431 tumor foci from EGFR mutant patients (group-M) and 1,238 foci from wild-type patients (group-W). The EGFR mutant frequencies in group-M were 80.6% (1,154/1,431) and 87.1% (1,247/1,431) using DHPLC and ARMS, respectively. A combination of EGFR-mutated and wild-type cells was detected in 32.9% (28/85) of samples by DHPLC and 28.2% (24/85) by ARMS, supporting the occurrence of intratumoral heterogeneity. Thirty-one patients (36.5%) were identified as EGFR FISH-positive. Patients harboring intratumoral mutational heterogeneity possessed lower EGFR copy numbers than those tumors contained mutant cells alone (16.7% vs. 71.0%, P<0.05). Among 26 patients who had received EGFR-TKIs, the mean EGFR mutation content was higher in patients showing partial response (86.1%) or stable disease (48.7%) compared with patients experiencing progressive disease (6.0%) (P = 0.001). There also showed relationship between progression-free survival (PFS) and different content of EGFR mutation groups (pure wild type EGFR, EGFR mutation with heterogeneity and pure mutated EGFR) (P = 0.001). Conclusion: Approximately 30% of patients presented intratumoral EGFR mutational heterogeneity, accompanying with relatively low EGFR copy number. EGFR mutant content was correlated with the response and prognosis of EGFR-TKIs. \u00a9 2013 Bai et al.", "pid": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1515104f"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Shuhang Wang", "org": "Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education)", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1508c016"}, {"name": "Tongtong An", "org": "Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education)", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1515ce75"}, {"name": "Jianchun Duan", "org": "Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education)", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f9a282"}, {"name": "Lijian Zhang", "org": "Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education)", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e1509f963"}, {"name": "Meina Wu", "org": "Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education)", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1517a427"}, {"name": "Qinghua Zhou", "org": "Department of Thoracic Surgery", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150b04d4"}, {"name": "Jinfeng Chen", "org": "Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education)", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fcc6b2"}, {"name": "Minglei Zhuo", "org": "Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education)", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150cb6e7"}, {"name": "Lu Yang", "org": "Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education)", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151e699a"}, {"name": "Yuyan Wang", "org": "Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education)", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15011d14"}, {"name": "Hua Bai", "org": "Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education)", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e151401f8"}, {"name": "Jie Wang", "org": "Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education)", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fa7cc4"}], "title": "Alterations in EGFR and Related Genes following Neo-Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Chinese Patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "year": 2013, "abstract": "Introduction: Genetic aberrancies within epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway are associated with therapeutic outcomes of EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the impact of chemotherapy on EGFR-related genes alterations has not been defined in NSCLC. Our study aims to investigate the impact of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (Neoadj-Chemo) on EGFR activating mutations and associated EGFR-TKIs resistance-related genes. Patients and Methods: Matched tumor samples were obtained retrospectively from 66 NSCLC patients (stages IIb-IIIb) corresponding to pre- and post- Neoadj-Chemo. EGFR mutations were detected by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and confirmed by Amplification Refractory Mutation System technology (ARMS), KRAS mutations, T790M mutation and c-MET amplification were identified using Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), ARMS, and real-time PCR, respectively. Results: Before Neoadj-Chemo, EGFR mutations were identified in 33.3% (22/66) of NSCLC patients. Only 18.2% (12/66) of patients carried EGFR mutations after Neoadj-Chemo (p = 0.013). The median peak value of EGFR 19 exon mutations decreased non-significantly after Neoadj-Chemo. KRAS mutation rate decreased from 4.6% (3/66) to 3.0% (2/66) with Neoadj-Chemo. Although the overall percentage of patients exhibiting c-MET amplifications (6.1% [4/66]) did not change with Neoadj-Chemo, two patients transitioned from negative to positive c-MET amplification, and two patients reversed these changes post-Neoadj-Chemo. T790M mutations were absent from all samples. Conclusion: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy tends to decrease the mutation frequency of EGFR mutation and downstream genes, which suggests that real-time samples analysis for genetic aberrancies within EGFR pathways have important value to delineate specific patient populations and facilitate individualized treatment. \u00a9 2013 Wang et al.", "pid": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fa34a6"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Zhen Wang", "org": "Department of Orthopaedics", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15030da3"}, {"name": "Zheng Guo", "org": "Department of Orthopaedics", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150e77c8"}, {"name": "Hua Bai", "org": "Department of Toxicology", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e151401f8"}, {"name": "Jing Li", "org": "Department of Orthopaedics", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e15175161"}, {"name": "Xiangdong Li", "org": "Department of Orthopaedics", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fb36de"}, {"name": "Guojing Chen", "org": "Department of Orthopaedics", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ff670b"}, {"name": "Jianxi Lu", "org": "Department of Orthopaedics", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1518d4fd"}], "title": "Clinical evaluation of \u03b2-TCP in the treatment of lacunar bone defects: A prospective, randomized controlled study", "keywords": ["\u03b2-TCP", "Clinical application", "Lacunar bone defects"], "venue": "Materials Science and Engineering C", "year": 2013, "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the potential wide application of beta tricalcium phosphate (\u03b2-TCP) only for bone defects as compared to allograft. 95 patients with a solitary bone cyst were randomly assigned to the treatment.

Treatment of C57 BL/6 mice with bleomycin increased fibroblast viability and collagen production and significantly downregulated Nrf2. In addition, prominent oxidative stress was indicated by changes in superoxide dismutase, catalase activity, and glutathione and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance levels. In a cell-based model, bleomycin suppressed Nrf2 activation via extracellular signal-related kinase phosphorylation, enhancing intracellular reactive oxygen species in lung fibroblasts and stimulating abnormal cell proliferation and collagen secretion. To confirm this novel mechanism of bleomycin-induced fibrogenesis, we attempted to upregulate Nrf2 and related antioxidant proteins in bleomycin-treated fibroblasts using a putative Nrf2 activator, caffeic acid phenethyl ester, and the results showed that bleomycin-induced fibroblast proliferation and collagen content were attenuated through improved redox balance.

One key approach to control HCC is chemoprevention by naturally occurring agents. This study aims at investigating the antitumor effect of oleanolic acid (OA) and the molecular mechanisms. BALB/c mice were injected subcutaneously with HepG2 cells to establish transplanted tumors. Apoptosis and cell cycle arrestrelated markers and signaling cascades were determined by western blot, immunofluorescence, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometric analysis. OA exhibited inhibitory effect on HCC through induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest both in transplanted tumors and in HepG2 cells. OA induced apoptosis through mitochondrial pathway, evidenced by inhibition of Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway, mitochondrial dysfunction, transient increase of adenosine triphosphate, increase of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, increased release of cytochrome c and activation of caspase/poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. Activation of mitochondrial apoptotic pathway may be due to reactive oxygen species generated by mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, resulted from enhancement of lipolysis regulated by cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate response elementbinding protein-hormone-sensitive lipase/peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor \u03b3 signaling. OA induced G2/M cell cycle arrest through p21-mediated downregulation of cyclin B1/cdc2. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and p53 were involved in OA-exerted effect, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase-p53 signaling played a central role in OA-activated cascades responsible for apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. OA demonstrated significant antitumor activities in HCC in vivo and in vitro models. These data provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the antitumor effect of OA. \u00a9 The Author 2013.

Methods: Tumor samples from 123 cases of LSCC were included in this study. PIK3CA mutations in exon 9 and 20 were screened by pyrosequencing and confirmed by clone sequencing or amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS). Denaturing performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) was employed for evaluation of EGFR mutation in exon 19, 21 and KRAS mutation. Results: PIK3CA mutations were found in 3 (2.4%) patients. The mutation type included E545K, E452Q and H1047R. Of these three patients, one coupled with EGFR mutation, and the other two coupled with PIK3CA amplification. All the three patients shared the same clinicopathologic characteristics: male, less than 60 years old, had smoke history, stage III and carried wild-type KRAS. Conclusions: The frequency of PIK3CA mutation is low in Chinese patients with LSCC.

Discovering the enhancer effects or synergies between bioactive components is valuable for resisting oxidative stress and improving health benefits. The aim of this study was to investigate a possible cooperation of natural antioxidant caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) with synthetic antioxidant Trolox in the model systems of chemical generation of free radicals, lipid peroxidation of microsomes and radiation-induced oxidative injury in L929 cells. Based on the intermolecular interaction between CAPE and Trolox, the present study shows a synergistic effect of CAPE and Trolox in combination on elimination of three different free radicals and inhibition of lipid peroxidation initiated by three different systems. CAPE and Trolox added simultaneously to the L929 cells exerted an enhanced preventive effect on the oxidative injury induced by radiation through decreasing ROS generation, protecting plasma membrane and increasing the ratios of reduced glutathione/oxidized glutathione and the expression of key antioxidant enzymes mediated by nuclear factor erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Our results showed for the first time that administration of CAPE and Trolox in combination may exert synergistic antioxidant effects, and further indicate that CAPE and Trolox combination functions mainly through scavenging ROS directly, inhibiting lipid peroxidation and promoting redox cycle of GSH mediated by Nrf2-regulated glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase expression. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We observed characteristic cancer-associated single-nucleotide variations and insertions/deletions in exomes of CTCs. These mutations provided information needed for individualized therapy, such as drug resistance and phenotypic transition, but were heterogeneous from cell to cell. In contrast, every CTC from an individual patient, regardless of the cancer subtypes, exhibited reproducible copy number variation (CNV) patterns, similar to those of the metastatic tumor of the same patient. Interestingly, different patients with the same lung cancer adenocarcinoma (ADC) shared similar CNV patterns in their CTCs.

Methods: We retrospectively screened 1,525 samples of Chinese patients with advanced NSCLC who underwent EGFR mutation detections in tumor tissues at Peking University Cancer Hospital between February 2006 and March 2011. Thirty-two cases harboring double mutations were included in this study. The Kaplan-Meier univariate analysis for prognostic factors of survival was applied. Results: Patients with double mutations accounted for 2.1% (32/1525) of the overall tested samples. Double mutations were more common in female, adenocarcinoma, non-smokers, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG0)-1 and stage IV patients. Twenty-one patients with double mutations were treated with EGFR-TKIs. The objective response rate (ORR) was 23.8%, and the disease control rate (DCR) was 76.2%. In the first-line therapy, the ORR was 16.7%, and the DCR was 66.7%.

In this retrospective study, we included a total of 290 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who received treatment with epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) and chemotherapy. Methods: The BIM deletion polymorphism of each patient was detected by polymerase chain reaction. EGFR mutations were detected by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography methods and the amplification refractory mutation system. Results: The BIM deletion polymorphism was detected in 45/290 (15.5%) Chinese NSCLC patients. No associations were observed between the BIM deletion and clinic-pathologic characteristics of patients. The BIM deletion polymorphism was predictive of shorter progression-free survival in Chinese patients with EGFR-mutant adenocarcinoma and who were treated with EGFR-TKIs (7.30 vs. 9.53 months, P = 0.034). Additionally, we found that the BIM deletion polymorphism was an effective predictor of short progression-free survival in individuals with EGFR-mutant NSCLC and treated with chemotherapy containing pemetrexed (3.32 vs. 5.30, P = 0.012) or second-/beyond-line chemotherapy containing taxanes (1.53 vs. 2.61 months, P = 0.025). The BIM deletion was not correlated with overall survival. Conclusion: The BIM deletion polymorphism occurs in 15.5% of Chinese NSCLC patients, and is a biomarker for resistance to TKIs and chemotherapy.

First, we analyzed the relationship between ER\u03b2 localization determined by immunohistochemistry and EGFR-TKI outcomes in 184 patients with advanced NSCLC and found that ER\u03b2 expression localized in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus. The frequency of cytoplasmic ER\u03b2 (c-ER\u03b2) and nuclear ER\u03b2 (n-ER\u03b2) co-expression was 12% (22/184). C-ER\u03b2 and n-ER\u03b2 co-expression was correlated with poor median progression-free survival compared to patients without co-expression. In subsequent in vitro experiments, PC9 cells transfected with ER\u03b2 isoform1 (ER\u03b21, strong expression of both c-ER\u03b2 and n-ER\u03b2) were more resistant to gefitinib than PC9 cells transfected with ER\u03b2 isoform2 or 5 (ER\u03b22 or ER\u03b25, strong expression of ER\u03b2 in cytoplasm but not nucleus). Resistance was identified due to interactions between ER\u03b21 and other isoforms, and mediated by activation of non-genomic pathways. Moreover, gefitinib resistance was reversed by a combination treatment with gefitinib and fulvestrant, both in cell lines and in one NSCLC patient. These results suggested that c-ER\u03b2 and n-ER\u03b2 co-expression was a potential molecular indicator of EGFR-TKI resistance, which might be overcome by combining EGFR-TKI and ER antagonist.", "pid": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150aa2c8"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Zhijie Wang", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology, Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Beijing Cancer Hospital, Beijing Institute for Cancer Research", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1518b403"}, {"name": "Zhirong Shen", "org": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Systems Biomedicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fdd293"}, {"name": "Zhenxiang Li", "org": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Shandong Cancer Hospital and Institute, Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e15186c9a"}, {"name": "Jianchun Duan", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology, Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Beijing Cancer Hospital, Beijing Institute for Cancer Research", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f9a282"}, {"name": "Shuai Fu", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology, Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Beijing Cancer Hospital, Beijing Institute for Cancer Research", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fd7635"}, {"name": "Zhentao Liu", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology, Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Beijing Cancer Hospital, Beijing Institute for Cancer Research", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f4a9b2"}, {"name": "Hua Bai", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology, Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Beijing Cancer Hospital, Beijing Institute for Cancer Research", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e151401f8"}, {"name": "Zemin Zhang", "org": "Biodynamic Optical Imaging Center, Integrated Science Research Center, Peking University", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150ab8e3"}, {"name": "Jun Zhao", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology, Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Beijing Cancer Hospital, Beijing Institute for Cancer Research", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150f643f"}, {"name": "Xiaodong Wang", "org": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Systems Biomedicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e15161f06"}, {"name": "Jie Wang", "org": "Department of Thoracic Medical Oncology, Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Beijing Cancer Hospital, Beijing Institute for Cancer Research", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f759e6"}], "title": "Activation of the BMP-BMPR pathway conferred resistance to EGFR-TKIs in lung squamous cell carcinoma patients with EGFR mutations", "keywords": ["Bone morphogenetic proteins", "Drug resistance", "Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor", "Lung squamous cell carcinoma"], "venue": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "year": 2015, "abstract": "The empirical criteria for defining a clinical subtype of lung cancer are gradually transiting from histopathology to genetic variations in driver genes.

However, the clinical benefit of molecularly targeted therapy on NSCLC appears to be different between lung adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas (SqCCs). We report here that the resistance of lung SqCC harboring EGFR mutations to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) was due to the activation of BMP-BMPR-Smad1/5-p70S6K. The combined treatment of these tumor cells with EGFR-TKI, together with inhibitors specific to BMPR or downstream mTOR, effectively reversed the resistance to EGFR-TKI. Moreover, blocking the whole PI3K-AKTmTOR pathway with the PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor BEZ235 also showed efficacy in treating this subtype of lung SqCC.

As envisaged in [hep-th/0503007], we construct an intersecting non-susy p-brane with chargeless non-susy q-brane by taking T-dualities along the delocalized directions of the non-susy q-brane solution delocalized in (p-q) transverse directions (where p q). In general these solutions are characterized by four independent parameters. We show that when q \u2264 0 the intersecting charged as well as chargeless non-susy p-brane with chargeless 0-brane can be mapped by a coordinate transformation to black p-brane when two of the four parameters characterizing the solution take some special values. For definiteness we restrict our discussion to space-time dimensions d \u2264 10. We observe that parameters characterizing the black brane and the related dynamics are in general in a different branch of the parameter space from those describing the brane-antibrane annihilation process.

In a single-reporter design, the transcriptional activator ccaR of CA biosynthesis was chosen as the over-expressing target, and neo (resistance to kanamycin) as the reporter; 51% of the selected mutants produced higher CA titer than the starting strain. To reduce the high false positive rate of single-reporter method, a double-reporter RGMS vector was configured, in which an xylE-neo double-reporter cassette was used to monitor ccaR expression; 90% of mutants selected by the modified method showed improvement in CA titer.

ManNAc is then condensed biocatalytically with pyruvate in the presence of N-acetyl-d-neuraminic acid lyase (NAL) or by a two-step, fully enzymatic process involving bioconversions of GlcNAc to ManNAc and ManNAc to Neu5Ac using N-acetyl-d-glucosamine 2-epimerase (AGE) and NAL.

Disruption of argR in Streptomyces clavuligerus NP1 resulted in complex phenotypic changes in growth and antibiotic production levels. To understand the metabolic changes underlying the phenotypes, comparative proteomic studies were carried out between NP1 and its argR disruption mutant (designated CZR). In CZR, enzymes involved in holomycin biosynthesis were overexpressed; this is consistent with its holomycin overproduction phenotype. The effects on clavulanic acid (CA) biosynthesis are more complex. Several proteins from the CA cluster were moderately overexpressed, whereas several proteins from the 5S clavam biosynthetic cluster and from the paralog cluster of CA and 5S clavam biosynthesis were severely downregulated. Obvious changes were also detected in primary metabolism, which are mainly reflected in the altered expression levels of proteins involved in acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) and cysteine biosynthesis. Since acetyl-CoA and cysteine are precursors for holomycin synthesis, overexpression of these proteins is consistent with the holomycin overproduction phenotype. The complex interplay between primary and secondary metabolism and between secondary metabolic pathways were revealed by these analyses, and the insights will guide further efforts to improve production levels of CA and holomycin in S. clavuligerus. \u00a9 2012, American Society for Microbiology.", "pid": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e15104435"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Fuhang Song", "org": "CAS Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f56865"}, {"name": "Biao Ren", "org": "Graduate University of Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e15101f57"}, {"name": "Ke Yu", "org": "Graduate University of Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e1500274b"}, {"name": "Caixia Chen", "org": "CAS Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150ece3b"}, {"name": "Hui Guo", "org": "CAS Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151f3940"}, {"name": "Na Yang", "org": "CAS Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150bd591"}, {"name": "Hong Gao", "org": "CAS Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15001859"}, {"name": "Xueting Liu", "org": "CAS Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e15050ae8"}, {"name": "Mei Liu", "org": "CAS Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f98dc1"}, {"name": "Yaojun Tong", "org": "Graduate University of Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f70985"}, {"name": "Huanqin Dai", "org": "CAS Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f8becd"}, {"name": "Hua Bai", "org": "Hisun Pharmaceutical Co.

Physical stability of etanercept was monitored by micro-flow imaging (MFI), dynamic light scattering (DLS), size-exclusion high pressure liquid chromatography (SE-HPLC) and far- and near-ultraviolet circular dichroism (far- and near-UV CD). One potential explanation of this phenomenon is that bubble collapses when the vacuum is applied, leads to substantial heat formation, and ultimately free radical formation. Subsequently, the effect of a free-radical scavenger (ascorbic acid, AA) on SbVP formation was also evaluated. Degassing of etanercept solution by applying vacuum caused substantial increase of SbVP, as detected by MFI and DLS. However, traditional techniques such as SE-HPLC could not detect any change. The addition of free-radical scavenger had minimal effect on SbVP formation, therefore the formation of free radicals was probably not the main cause for this effect. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier B.V.", "pid": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f7d287"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Jianhua Guo", "org": "Sch. of Econ. and Mgmt.", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e151fdbab"}, {"name": "Hua Bai", "org": "Syst.

When the output voltage is greater than the maximum rated voltage, IGCTs are connected in series. To ensure the safe and reliable operation of the converter/inverters, special measures are required to equalize the voltages across the IGCTs connected in series. An effective method for balancing voltages is to use resistors for static voltage balancing and RC snubber circuits for dynamic voltage balancing. However, most of the previous research work reported in the literature focused on the dynamic circuit design for converters of the BUCK topology. Trade off is made only between the performance of dynamic voltage balancing and the turn-on loss without any consideration of di/dt endurance and any procedural steps, which makes the design procedure not suitable for converters of the three-level topology. Based on a functional model of IGCTs, this paper presents a procedure for optimum design of the dynamic voltage balancing circuit for a 6 kV/1250 kW inverter. The specific transient processes in the three-level topology with dynamic snubber circuit are simulated and the mechanisms are analyzed, which is absent in the previous work. \u00a92007 IEEE.", "pid": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f9b3b5"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Ting Lu", "org": "State Key Lab. of Control and Simulation of Power Systems and Generation Equipment", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fb2b46"}, {"name": "Zhengming Zhao", "org": "State Key Lab. of Control and Simulation of Power Systems and Generation Equipment", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e150861e4"}, {"name": "Yingchao Zhang", "org": "State Key Lab. of Control and Simulation of Power Systems and Generation Equipment", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151cee29"}, {"name": "Hua Bai", "org": "State Key Lab. of Control and Simulation of Power Systems and Generation Equipment", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f82659"}, {"name": "Liqiang Yuan", "org": "State Key Lab. of Control and Simulation of Power Systems and Generation Equipment", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15113287"}], "title": "Optimized CAN communications software in high power converters", "keywords": ["Communications software", "Controller area network (CAN)", "High power converters", "Optimized design"], "venue": "Qinghua Daxue Xuebao/Journal of Tsinghua University", "year": 2007, "abstract": "Communications can be disrupted by high data error in high power converters especially in strong electromagnetic environments.

Three new concepts for power electronic converters are introduced and validated in this paper: 1) sneak pulse; 2) energy dead band; and 3) transient commutating topology. \u00a9 2009 IEEE.", "pid": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e15174fb4"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Xiao-Ran Yang", "org": "Chinese Academy of Inspection and Quarantine", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1514ddde"}, {"name": "Yi-Yang Dong", "org": "Chinese Academy of Inspection and Quarantine", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1501b4e5"}, {"name": "Ming Li", "org": "Chinese Academy of Inspection and Quarantine", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fa804e"}, {"name": "Hong-Yan Zheng", "org": "Chinese Academy of Inspection and Quarantine", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1506ffd4"}, {"name": "Hua Bai", "org": "Chinese Academy of Inspection and Quarantine", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f82659"}, {"name": "Yan Cheng", "org": "Chinese Academy of Inspection and Quarantine", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15026444"}, {"name": "Yun-Dong Zou", "org": "Chinese Academy of Inspection and Quarantine", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15129907"}, {"name": "Dong-Mei Ren", "org": "Chinese Academy of Inspection and Quarantine", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e151627cd"}, {"name": "Jun-Bing Wang", "org": "Chinese Academy of Inspection and Quarantine", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f840b9"}], "title": "Chorioallantoic membrane trypan blue test predicts the potential human eye irritation induced by various chemicals", "venue": "Journal of Clinical Rehabilitative Tissue Engineering Research", "year": 2009, "abstract": "Background: Draize test has been used to predict eye potential irritation of chemicals, limiting by time-consuming, strenuous, and causing great pain for animals. At present, studies based on alternative models to replace this assay are in development. Objective: To use the hen'egg test-chorioallantoic membrane trypan blue (CAM-TB) as an alternative method of Draize eye irritation test to test the chemical eye irritation. Design, time and setting: The alternative experiment was performed at the Laboratory of Toxicology, Chinese Academy of Inspection and Quarantine, from May to September 2008. Materials: SPF hatching eggs of 9-day old was bought from Merial-Vital Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd. Methods: Using the chorioallantoic membrane trypan blue test, trypan blue solution were placed onto the CAM which injured by chemicals, the irritation potential of chemicals to CAM were calculated using the amount of trypan blue (nmol) absorbed by the CAM. The results were compared with Draize eye irritation test. Moreover eye irritations of 5 common solutions were forecasted by the CAM-TBS test. Main outcome measures: The amount of trypan blue (nmol) absorbed by the CAM. Results: The correlation coefficient between CAM-TB score and Draize eye irritation was 0.925 9. Glycerol had no eye irritation potential, while acet, alcohol, methanol and DMSO had. When they were diluted to 1%, the eye irritation of acet, alcohol and DMSO were little, while methanol had eye irritation still. Conclusion: CAM-TBS can be used as an alternative method of Draize eye irritation to test chemical eye irritation.", "pid": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e15169961"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Youqiang Chen", "org": "Department of Chemistry", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e15141e2e"}, {"name": "Hua Bai", "org": "Department of Chemistry", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f82659"}, {"name": "Qi Chen", "org": "Department of Chemistry", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f9a692"}, {"name": "Chun Li", "org": "Department of Chemistry", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f51804"}, {"name": "Gaoquan Shi", "org": "Department of Chemistry", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151b7642"}], "title": "A water-soluble cationic oligopyrene derivative: Spectroscopic studies and sensing applications", "keywords": ["2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene", "Fluorescence quenching", "SDS", "Water-soluble oligopyrene"], "venue": "Sensors and Actuators, B: Chemical", "year": 2009, "abstract": "A water-soluble cationic conjugated oligomer, oligo(2-(4-(1-pyrenyl)butanoyloxy)ethyltrimethylammonium bromide) (OPBEAB) was synthesized by the combination of chemical and electrochemical synthesis techniques.

This paper put the fuzzy neural network into a constant-current-controlled spot welding inverter, where the welding current peak and its variation are adopted as the input parameters and the duty ratio of the switches is regarded as the output.

The first-dimensional HILIC was performed on porous silica stationary phase using acetonitrile-water gradient elution, which was readily compatible with electrospray ionization (ESI), and enabled good chromatographic separation of APEO oligomers on account of their differences in ethoxy chain length. Maintaining the fidelity of pre-ionization resolution in the first dimension, the second-dimensional IM-MS employed a hybrid quadrupole ion mobility time-of-flight mass spectrometer and added an orthogonal post-ionization separation for APEOs based on their size, shape and electric charge during a very short period of 13.0 ms. By virtue of the combination of HILIC and IM-MS, comprehensive resolution according to both hydrophobicity difference and mobility disparity has been achieved for APEO ethoxy homologues. The orthogonality of the developed two-dimensional system was evaluated with the correlation coefficient and peak spreading angle of 0.2191 and 77.34\u00b0 for octylphenol ethoxylates (OPEOs), and 0.1490 and 81.43\u00b0 for nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEOs). A significant enhancement in peak capacity was achieved for the comprehensive two-dimensional plane with the actual peak capacity calculated to be approximately 7 and 122 times higher than that of the two dimensions used alone, respectively. The attractive potential for removing the effects of isobaric interference of APEOs by the rapid and solvent-free ion mobility approach was also highlighted. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The GO-CS hydrogels were prepared via self-assembly of GO sheets and CS chains. A three-dimensional network composed of GO sheets crosslinked by CS was found in GO-CS hydrogels. The GO-CS composite hydrogels showed high adsorption capacity towards different contaminants, including cationic and anionic dyes, as well as heavy metal ions. The mechanism of the dye adsorption was investigated with a spectral method, and an electrostatic interaction was found to be the major interaction between ionic dyes and the hydrogel. The influence of the hydrogel composition on the adsorption capacity towards different adsorbates was also studied. Finally, it was demonstrated that the GO-CS hydrogel can be used as column packing, to fabricate a column for water purification by filtration. \u00a9  The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.", "pid": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fb3e34"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Hua Bai", "org": "Inspection and Research Center of Nanomaterials and Nanoproducts (NIRC)", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f82659"}, {"name": "Ning Su", "org": "Inspection and Research Center of Nanomaterials and Nanoproducts (NIRC)", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150c099c"}, {"name": "Wentao Li", "org": "Inspection and Research Center of Nanomaterials and Nanoproducts (NIRC)", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e151651ba"}, {"name": "Xuan Zhang", "org": "Inspection and Research Center of Nanomaterials and Nanoproducts (NIRC)", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1514fe22"}, {"name": "Yan Yan", "org": "Inspection and Research Center of Nanomaterials and Nanoproducts (NIRC)", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150e7ca5"}, {"name": "Peng Li", "org": "International Center for Materials Nanoarchitectonic", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e150041fd"}, {"name": "Shuxin Ouyang", "org": "International Center for Materials Nanoarchitectonic", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150fab80"}, {"name": "Jinhua Ye", "org": "International Center for Materials Nanoarchitectonic", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e150488aa"}, {"name": "Guangcheng Xi", "org": "Inspection and Research Center of Nanomaterials and Nanoproducts (NIRC)", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15030e9c"}], "title": "W", "venue": "Journal of Materials Chemistry A", "year": 2013, "abstract": "We report the facile one-pot synthesis of self-organized W ", "pid": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1504fc91"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Hua Bai", "org": "School of Environment", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f82659"}, {"name": "Si-Yu Zeng", "org": "School of Environment", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ff6bf3"}, {"name": "Xin Dong", "org": "School of Environment", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ff5883"}, {"name": "Ji-Ning Chen", "org": "School of Environment", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e15203714"}], "title": "Research of potassium flow and circulation based on substance flow analysis", "keywords": ["Domestic wastewater", "Nutrient loss", "Potassium", "Substance flow analysis", "Water environment"], "venue": "Huanjing Kexue/Environmental Science", "year": 2013, "abstract": "Mass of potassium is consumed in the process of crop production, which is the dominating section of potassium flow and circulation in China.

The mass spectrometric parameters were finely optimized to favor the observation of noncovalent complexes. The experimental data confirm that due to the close structural resemblance with thyroid hormone thyroxine, some OH-PBDEs have been shown to conjugate with BSA. It is found that BSA preferentially interacts with one OH-octaBDE (4\u2032-OH-BDE-201) and two hydroxylated heptabromodiphenyl ether (OH-heptaBDE) isomers (4-OH-BDE-187 and 6-OH-BDE-180) with 1:1 and 2:1 binding stoichiometries. The state of bound OH-PBDEs is inferred to be as both neutral and anionic species. The dissociation constants of corresponding noncovalent complexes are calculated by titration curve data fitting. Investigation into various OH-PBDE analogs demonstrates that both the degree of bromination and the positions of hydroxylation and bromine moieties may exert influence on the binding of OH-PBDEs to BSA. The possible conformational changes in BSA induced upon the binding of OH-PBDEs were explored by use of ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS) to understand the details of the interactions in structural aspects. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, the migration risk caused by toxic toys is difficult to estimate if the migration regularity of these substances is unknown. In this study, a method was established to investigate the migration regularity of toxic substances, specifically styrene, from acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene toys to saliva and sweat. Two determination methods of the residual amount and migration amount were initially developed and then utilized to obtain specific migration data by using a self-made migration device. Migration models were established according to Fick's second law; the models included a diffusion coefficient and a partition coefficient calculated on the basis of the obtained migration data. These models were then applied to predict the migration behavior of styrene in real toys; afterward, predicted findings were subsequently compared with experimental data. The experimental data were consistent with the predicted findings and thus verified the validity of the migration models. Using this approach, we can determine the migration regularity of other toxic substances in toys; the predictability of the risk caused by toxic toys is also a relevant factor to promote toy safety.", "pid": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fee85d"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Xin-Lian Luo", "org": "Department of Astronomy", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151ad3e4"}, {"name": "Qiu-He Peng", "org": "Open Lab.

Methods: All studies were conducted in 10 adult SD male rats (aged 2 months). The distribution and location of NGB proteins in the eyeball of rats was examined by a sensitive immunohistochemical ABC method. Results: NGB was mainly expressed in all neurons of the retina but not in the retinal pigment epithelium. It was also expressed in iris, ciliary and optic nerves in small amount but undetectable in other ocular tissues. NGB protein was mainly found in plexiform layers of retina and ellipsoid region of photoreceptor inner segment. The distribution of NGB was correlated with the localizations of subcellular organs (mitochondria) and retinal relative oxygen demands, as most of the retinal oxygen was consumed in these locations.

The adhesion ability of treated NHCEKs was then assessed by cell adhesion assay. Immunoblot and immunohistochemistry were conducted to determine the level of two focal adhesion-related proteins, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and paxillin (Pax).

To compare the corneal biomechanical properties of keratoconic patients and age-matched controls using corneal visualization Scheimpflug technology (Corvis ST). Methods. Sixty keratoconic eyes from 47 keratoconus patients and 60 normal eyes from 60 controls were enrolled in this prospective study. Tomography and biomechanical parameters of all eyes were obtained with the Pentacam and Corvis ST, respectively. Intraocular pressure was measured using a Goldmann applanation tonometer. Results. The tomography and biomechanical parameters of the keratoconic corneas were significantly different from those of the normal corneas except for the anterior chamber angle, first applanation length, the highest concavity time, and peak distance. The deformation amplitude was the best predictive parameter (area under the curve: 0.882), with a sensitivity of 81.7%, although there was a significant overlap between keratoconic and normal corneas that ranged from 1.0 to 1.4 mm. In both the keratoconus and control groups, the deformation amplitude was negatively correlated with intraocular pressure, central corneal thickness, and corneal volume at 3 and 5 mm. Conclusions. Corvis ST offers an alternative method for measuring corneal biomechanical properties. The possibility of classifying keratoconus based on deformation amplitude deserves clinical attention. \u00a9 2014 Lei Tian et al.", "pid": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fe5444"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Yuxia Li", "org": "Institute of Molecular Medicine, Medical School, Henan University", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1515c290"}, {"name": "Hua Bai", "org": "Departmentof Ophthalmology, Military General Hospitalof Beijing PLA", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150eeb9b"}, {"name": "Zhongzu Zhang", "org": "Department of Biochemistry, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS), Peking Union Medical College (PUMC)", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151f76ed"}, {"name": "Weihua Li", "org": "Henan University Hospital, Huaihe Henan University Clinical College", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150a717e"}, {"name": "Lei Dong", "org": "Department of Biochemistry, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS), Peking Union Medical College (PUMC)", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fa1531"}, {"name": "Xueju Wei", "org": "Institute of Molecular Medicine, Medical School, Henan University", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1504db13"}, {"name": "Yanni Ma", "org": "Department of Biochemistry, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS), Peking Union Medical College (PUMC)", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f551ec"}, {"name": "Junwu Zhang", "org": "Department of Biochemistry, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS), Peking Union Medical College (PUMC)", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150a1fe9"}, {"name": "Jia Yu", "org": "Department of Biochemistry, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS), Peking Union Medical College (PUMC)", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f84f29"}, {"name": "Guotao Sun", "org": "Institute of Molecular Medicine, Medical School, Henan University", "id": "5b5433e3e1cd8e4e15f4526a"}, {"name": "Fang Wang", "org": "Department of Biochemistry, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS), Peking Union Medical College (PUMC)", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f976f2"}], "title": "The up-regulation of miR-199b-5p in erythroid differentiation is associated with GATA-1 and NF-E2", "keywords": ["C-Kit", "Erythroid differentiation", "GATA-1", "MicroRNA-199b-5p", "NF-E2"], "venue": "Molecules and Cells", "year": 2014, "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent a class of small non-coding regulatory RNAs that play important roles in normal hematopoiesis, including erythropoiesis. Although studies have identified several miRNAs that regulate erythroid commitment and differentiation, we do not understand the mechanism by which the crucial erythroid transcription factors, GATA-1and NF-E2 directly regulate and control differentiation via miRNA pathways. In this study, we identified miR-199b-5p as a key regulator of human erythropoiesis, and its expression was up-regulated during the erythroid differentiation of K562 cells. Furthermore, the increase of miR-199b-5p in erythroid cells occurred in a GATA-1- and NF-E2-dependent manner during erythrocyte maturation. Both GATA-1 and NF-E2 bound upstream of the miR-199b gene locus and activated its transcription. Forced expression of miRNA-199b-5p in K562 cells affected erythroid cell proliferation and maturation. Moreover, we identified c-Kit as a direct target of miR-199b-5p in erythroid cells. Taken together, our results establish a functional link among the erythroid transcription factors GATA-1/NF-E2, miR-199b-5p and c-Kit, and provide new insights into the coupling of transcription and post-transcription regulation in erythroid differentiation. \u00a9 The Korean Society for Molecular and Cellular Biology.

After 6 months foUowing the obturation,8 teeth of each experimental group were stained by methylee blue and then made into transparent teeth model, and other 2 teeth were observed by scanning electron microscope. [Results] There was no significant difference among the experimental groups in 1,4,7 days(P > 0.05). The microleakage of each group were Group D < Group C < Group B < Group A,and there was significant difference among the experimental groups after 10 days(P <0.05). Dye penetration showed that the longth of dye staining was no significant difference. Scanning electron mircoscop showed that the filling materials in Group D attached most closely to the root canal wall.

More focus was concentrated on the long-span bridges than that on such short-span and narrow bridges as pedestrian bridge. The results become such that the long-span bridges are paid close attention to aerodynamic stability. The potential consequence is short-span bridges' aerodynamic stability is presumably neglected by designer (Liu, 2007). Obviously, the aerodynamic stability of bridge doesn't only depend on the span but also on such factors as natural properties and deck width etc. Based on this point, the narrow bridges are more prone to catastrophe for their stabilities are easily ignored by designer. This paper illustrates wind tunnel test investigation into the mitigation measures to improve aerodynamic stability of narrow bridges with the example of a suspension pedestrian bridge across a seasonal river in Xinjiang Province of China. The wind tunnel test results implied that the critical wind speed of flutter of the original scheme did not meet the provision in the Wind-resistant Design Specification for Highway Bridges (Xiang, 2004). The scaled model with alternative mitigation measures were re-conducted in wind tunnel to judge which is the best alternatives in improving the critical wind speed of flutter.

According to the similarity relation related to the gradient wind speed, and referencing the gradient wind speed stipulated in the wind-resistant design code, a method of calculating design wind speed of bridge in agreement with the wind speed profile and the magnitude of the gradient wind speed measured at the bridge site in wind tunnel test was proposed. Test results show that the wind speed profile is of a power-law distribution, when the coming wind is parallel to the trend of the valley. The wind speed profile in other directions cannot be simulated by a uniform power-law relationship. The power exponent of wind speed profile parallel to the trend of the valley is less than those in other directions, and the value is equal to 0.142. The intensity of turbulence in the valley is the largest, especially near the side slope, and the value is bigger than 15% at the upper part of bridge deck near midspan.

The final percent germination of A. sphaerocephala was higher in dark than in light at low temperature regime (10:20t). The final percent germination was lower for seeds from Yulin than those from Otog and Ejin Horo (6.4%-54.4% and 0.8%-48% lower, respectively). In dark condition, the final percent germination was lower for dry seeds than fresh seeds and seeds stored in natural habitats (6.4% -41.6% and 2.4% -39.2% lower, respectively). It was also found that the final percent germination was mostly lower for seeds gathered from lower part of branches than from upper ones (2. 4%-41. 6% ). These results support the findings by Zheng et al that lower temperatures and strong light inhibit the seed germination of A. sphaerocephala. Hence, efforts should be made so that seeds could be covered with sands after air seeding to facilitate seed germination in dark condition.", "pid": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15117ff3"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Qiu-Shuang Li", "org": "Graduate University of Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151baa22"}, {"name": "Chao Zhang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Vegetation and Environmental Change", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e15165a00"}, {"name": "Fei Wang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Vegetation and Environmental Change", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fa7435"}, {"name": "Li-Ming Lai", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Vegetation and Environmental Change", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e15067301"}, {"name": "Li Zhang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Vegetation and Environmental Change", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1503809b"}, {"name": "Wen-Ting Li", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Vegetation and Environmental Change", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151ef82a"}, {"name": "Hua Bai", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Vegetation and Environmental Change", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15014a6b"}, {"name": "Yuan-Run Zheng", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Vegetation and Environmental Change", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150c68aa"}], "title": "Responses of spatial distribution pattern of Artemisia ordosica population to the precipitation gradient on Ordos Plateau", "keywords": ["Artemisia ordosica", "Distribution pattern", "Ordos plateau", "Point pattern", "Precipitation gradient", "Variance mean ratio method"], "venue": "Chinese Journal of Applied Ecology", "year": 2009, "abstract": "Five sites along the precipitation gradient (336-249 mm \u00b7 a ", "pid": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e15182611"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Liming Lai", "org": "Graduate School of the Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e15067301"}, {"name": "Yuanrun Zheng", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Vegetation and Environmental Change", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150c68aa"}, {"name": "Hua Bai", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Vegetation and Environmental Change", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15014a6b"}, {"name": "Yunjiang Yu", "org": "Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1504ea58"}, {"name": "Ping An", "org": "Arid Land Research Centre", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e15079a6a"}, {"name": "Xiangjun Li", "org": "Arid Land Research Centre", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f8169d"}, {"name": "Glyn M.

However, there are two different conclusions about the effect of light on their germination: light promotes germination versus light inhibits germination. The aim of this study was to evaluate these two conclusions and relate the results to instances of failure of these two species to germinate well when air-dispersed in revegetation projects. The effects of fluctuating temperature, light/dark, source (population), position on mother plant, storage condition, and storage time were tested on germination of achenes of these two species. At low temperature, final percent germination (FPG) of achenes in dark and nearly dark conditions was significantly higher than those in light. At 10:20\u00b0C, achenes of both A. sphaerocephala and A. ordosica had higher FPG in dark than in light regardless of source, position on mother plants or storage condition. At suboptimum (5:15\u00b0C) and supraoptimal (25:35\u00b0C) temperatures, germination of A. sphaerocephala and A. ordosica achenes was inhibited in both light and darkness. It was concluded that light inhibits germination of A. sphaerocephala and A. ordosica achenes at low (10:20\u00b0C) temperature but not at high (15:25\u00b0C) temperature. Since the temperature in Mu Us sandy land is around 10:20\u00b0C in early June, when air sowing is done, achenes should germinate best when they are covered by a thin layer of sand. \u00a9 2010 The Ecological Society of Japan.", "pid": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1511ec77"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Hua Bai", "org": "Department of Hematology", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e151242a2"}, {"name": "Zhong Li", "org": "Department of Hematology", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15129fb5"}, {"name": "Wei-Wu Chen", "org": "Qizheng Tibetan Medicine Marketing Ltd.", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e1520af47"}, {"name": "Miao Jiang", "org": "Department of Hematology", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150f65d6"}, {"name": "Ya-Yue Zhang", "org": "Department of Hematology", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150d5c77"}], "title": "Research of establishing a mouse model of femur cancer pain with Lewis lung cancer cell lines", "keywords": ["Bone neoplasms/complications", "Disease models, animal", "Pain"], "venue": "Chinese Journal of Cancer Prevention and Treatment", "year": 2009, "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To establish a simple and useful animal model of cancer pain with Lewis lung cancer cell lines.

The development of the bone tumor and structural damage to the bone was monitored by radiological analysis and histology. RESULTS: The mice following intra-femur injections of lewis lung cancer cells displayed the gradual development of mechanical allodynia and hyperalgesia, beginning on day 8 after the injection of the tumor cells. On day 14 the radiograph of the femur showed clear bone destruction, and the histology analysis indicated that the tumor cells grew and invaded the cortical bone.

At the same time, a 4CL1 gene was cloned from P. tomentosa, too. The two genes were subcloned in pQE31 vector and expressed in Escherichia coli M15. Both of them were purified by Ni-NTA. Purified CCR protein was digested by trypsin and analyzed by HPLC-MS; the peptide segments had 27% similarity with the sequence of the CCR protein. 4CL was thought to be a neighbor enzyme of CCR in lignin biosynthesis. In this paper, a 4CL1 from P. tomentosa was cloned, and its enzyme reaction products were extracted for the substrates of CCR. Three 4CL1 enzyme reaction products were monitored by HPLC-MS and then the CCR enzyme reaction was detected by GC-MS. In the CCR reaction, the three corresponding aldehyde (p-coumaraldehyde, caffealdehyde, and coniferaldehyde) were detected and identified by Frontier3 software. The results showed that the CCR that we cloned from P. tomentosa had affinities with 4CL1 enzyme reaction products and a ptCCR that was cloned from aspen (Li et al., Plant Cell Physiol 46(7):1073-1082, 2005) only had affinity with feruloyl-CoA. The different results maybe depend on the different study method. The method of exacting 4CL enzyme products as the substrates of CCR in the paper was reliable and can be used in lignin biosynthesis network to detect the enzymes in the neighborhood that depended on the polarity of the substrates and products. This CCR gene had eight homology sequence CCR gene when a BLAST was conducted in Populus trichocarpa genome database. The CCR homology genes in Populus suggested that some CCRs may take part in the lignin biosynthesis, too. The gene family would be the hot spot in the future study. \u00a9 The Botanical Society of Korea 2009.", "pid": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1518888e"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Jun Chen", "org": "School of Transportation", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150dffb0"}, {"name": "Huanhuan Chao", "org": "Wu xi Communications Industry Group Co., Ltd.", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e150376cb"}, {"name": "Hua Bai", "org": "School of Transportation", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f6595b"}], "title": "Empirical correlation analysis of parking arrival and departure rates for urban parking facilities", "keywords": ["Correlation analysis", "Forecasting model", "Parking arrival rates", "Parking departure rates"], "venue": "Proceedings of the 9th International Conference of Chinese Transportation Professionals, ICCTP 2009: Critical Issues in Transportation System Planning, Development, and Management", "year": 2009, "abstract": "To improve the effects of urban parking facilities' management and control, this paper collected 10 hours data consecutively on parking arrival and departure rates from one off-street park in central Nanjing city in China and sets the time series marshal as an interval of 15 minutes.

A Granger causality test model was used to analyze the three characteristics mentioned above. Conclusions were drew that, in specific time sections, the lagged parking arrival rates can affect the value of the current parking departure rate and occupancy rates of valid parking berths distinctly, while the lagged parking departure rates can greatly affect the value of current occupancy rates of valid parking berths. Finally, forecasting models of parking arrival and departure rates were set up based on correlation analysis, and the results show that these models demonstrate promising performance for modeling parking arrival and departure rates. \u00a9 2009 ASCE.", "pid": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1516042e"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Hua Bai", "org": "School of Transportation", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f6595b"}, {"name": "Jun Chen", "org": "Department of Civil, Environmental, and Sustainable Engineering", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150dffb0"}, {"name": "Zhiquan Xie", "org": "Shanghai ji'An Transportation Consulting CO., Ltd.", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f94c47"}], "title": "A multiple attributive decision-making method for the number of lanes based on delay cost", "keywords": ["China", "Costs", "Decision making", "Delay time", "Traffic management"], "venue": "ICCTP 2010: Integrated Transportation Systems: Green, Intelligent, Reliable - Proceedings of the 10th International Conference of Chinese Transportation Professionals", "year": 2010, "abstract": "This paper focuses on traffic delay due to the number of lanes associated with building cost and appended cost.

Therefore, a novel antibiotic susceptibility test is urgently needed that can both precisely determine the MIC and accurately select antibiotic-resistant strains from clinical bacterial populations. For this purpose, we developed a method based on Fick's laws of diffusion using agar plates containing a linear gradient of antibiotic. The gradient plate contained two layers. The bottom layer consisted of 15 mL agar containing the appropriate concentration of enrofloxacin and allowed to harden in the form of a wedge with the plate slanted such that the entire bottom was just covered. The upper layer consisted of 15 mL plain nutrient agar added with the plate held in the horizontal position. After allowing vertical diffusion of the drug from the bottom agar layer for 12 h, the enrofloxacin concentration was diluted in proportion to the ratio of the agar layer thicknesses. The uniform linear concentration gradient was verified by measuring the enrofloxacin concentration on the agar surface. When heavy bacterial suspensions were spread on the agar surface and incubated for more than 12 h, only resistant cells were able to form colonies beyond the boundary of confluent growth of susceptible cells. In this way, the true MIC of enrofloxacin was determined. The MICs obtained using this linear gradient plate were consistent with those obtained using conventional antibiotic susceptibility tests. Discrete colonies were then spread onto a gradient plate with higher antibiotic concentrations; the boundary line increased significantly, and gene mutations conferring resistance were identified. This new method enables the rapid identification of resistant strains in the bacterial population. Use of the linear gradient plate can easily identify the precise MIC and reveal the dynamic differentiation of bacteria near the MIC. This method allows the study of genetic and physiological characteristics of individual strains, and may be useful for early warning of antibiotic resistance that may occur after use of certain antimicrobial agents, and guide clinical treatment. \u00a9 2011 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.", "pid": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e150274c7"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Hua Bai", "org": "Institute of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e150123e9"}, {"name": "Jia-Fa Du", "org": "Institute of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151a4d0d"}, {"name": "Ming Hu", "org": "Institute of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150abf83"}, {"name": "Jing Qi", "org": "Institute of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e15046b1b"}, {"name": "Ya-Na Cai", "org": "Institute of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151f61e7"}, {"name": "Wei-Wei Niu", "org": "Institute of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1512949d"}, {"name": "Yu-Qing Liu", "org": "Institute of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e15139230"}], "title": "Analysis of mechanisms of resistance and tolerance of Escherichia coli to enrofloxacin", "keywords": ["Drug resistance", "Drug tolerance", "Enrofloxacin", "Escherichia coli", "Mechanisms"], "venue": "Annals of Microbiology", "year": 2012, "abstract": "The mechanisms behind reduced bacterial sensitivity to drugs and the nature of this phenomenon were explored. Escherichia coli were treated with a sub-inhibitory dose or a repeatedly doubled dose of enrofloxacin (EN) in vitro. After 10 serial passages, the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of EN to the bacteria was assessed by changes in expression of genes involved in the SOS response, drug efflux pumps, porins and EN targets, and the mutation of the quinolone resistance determining region (QRDR). The results showed that the MIC of EN to E. coli was higher after a single passage when treated with either concentration of EN compared with that of the controls (0.5 \u03bcg/ml). From this point onwards, the MIC of E. coli treated with the sub-inhibitory concentration tended to be stable, whilst it increased continuously to 64 \u03bcg/ml when treated with the doubling dose. Regardless of the EN concentration that bacteria were exposed to, their efflux pumps were started, the expression of the SOS regulatory genes recA and umuC and EN target gene parC were significantly up-regulated, and the expression of the porins gene ompW was significantly down-regulated. No mutations were detected in the QRDR of E. coli treated with the sub-inhibitory concentration of EN, but mutations at three sites occurred after treatment with the repeatedly doubling dose. The current results suggest that the reduction in sensitivity of bacteria to drugs is positively, but non-linearly, correlated with the concentration of drugs used. The E. coli studied initiated mechanisms to adapt to the enrofloxacin stress which included an SOS response, target gene mutations and efflux pump activity and so on. These adaptive mechanisms are interactive, but the inherited and non-inherited mechanisms play different roles in the adaptation of bacteria to drugs. \u00a9 Springer-Verlag and the University of Milan 2011.", "pid": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fade58"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Jing Qi", "org": "Shandong Key Laboratory of Animal Disease Control and Breeding", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e15046b1b"}, {"name": "Yijun Du", "org": "Shandong Key Laboratory of Animal Disease Control and Breeding", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e150278cf"}, {"name": "Xiaoling Zhu", "org": "Shandong Key Laboratory of Animal Disease Control and Breeding", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150fae5f"}, {"name": "Hua Bai", "org": "Shandong Key Laboratory of Animal Disease Control and Breeding", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e150123e9"}, {"name": "Yanbo Luo", "org": "Shandong Key Laboratory of Animal Disease Control and Breeding", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150d9fb8"}, {"name": "Yuqing Liu", "org": "Shandong Key Laboratory of Animal Disease Control and Breeding", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e15139230"}], "title": "A loop-mediated isothermal amplification method for rapid detection of NDM-1 gene", "venue": "Microbial Drug Resistance", "year": 2012, "abstract": "A loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method was developed for the rapid and sensitive detection of the emerging resistance gene New Delhi Metallo-\u03b2-lactamase-1 (NDM-1), with its specificity and sensitivity having been evaluated.

Differentially expressed proteins of the whole-cell extracts were visualized by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and the selected proteins were purified and identified by MALDI-TOF/mass spectrometry analysis. The result showed that the number of proteins (mean\u00b1standard deviation) detected in the ENR-treated strains was significantly (p<0.05) reduced from 1115\u00b125 to 732\u00b119.

Objective.- We conducted a one-year survey on the prevalence and burden of primary headache in the Chinese provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi. Our study also evaluated the factors behind similarities and differences affecting prevalence in the 2 regions of study. Methods.- Random samples of 372 local residents in Guangdong and 182 local residents in Guangxi aged 18-65 years were invited to a face-to-face interview. Results.- The one-year prevalence of primary headache was 22.6% (84/372) in Guangdong and 41.2% (75/182) in Guangxi. The prevalence of migraine (14.3%, n=26) in Guangxi was higher than prevalence of migraine (8.3%, n=31) in Guangdong (P=.03). The ratio of headache cost and household income was 2.1% in Guangdong and 3.7% in Guangxi, the ratio in Guangdong was less than that in Guangxi (P=.001). The diagnostic confirmation rate of migraine was low. No migraineur used triptans drugs to treat migraine in either region. Conclusion.- Migraine prevalence was higher in the lower-income region that also contains a higher proportion of ethnic minorities. Although there was no difference of headache cost between the 2 regions, the headache populations in the lower-income region would relatively suffer a greater financial burden if taking the economic differences between the 2 regions into account. The improvement of diagnostic and therapeutic levels for the treatment of headache, especially migraine, in the 2 regions may be a matter of urgency. \u00a9 2010 American Headache Society.", "pid": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e15081c55"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Ning Luo", "org": "Affiliated Liuzhou Hospital, Southern Medical University", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fc9bf6"}, {"name": "Weiwei Qi", "org": "Sun Yat-Sen University", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1501b51b"}, {"name": "Wangxia Tong", "org": "Affiliated Liuzhou Hospital, Southern Medical University", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151cc2e0"}, {"name": "Feng Tan", "org": "Foshan Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151cb326"}, {"name": "Qian Zhang", "org": "First People's Hospital of Nanning", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e15144ce0"}, {"name": "Jianmin He", "org": "Affiliated Liuzhou Hospital, Southern Medical University", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e150576f0"}, {"name": "Daliang Zou", "org": "Zhongshan Chenxinghai Hospital", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1515cdda"}, {"name": "Xiutang Cao", "org": "Institute of Hospital Management, Chinese PLA General Hospital", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fc48f3"}, {"name": "Xuehua Xu", "org": "Foshan Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fd40a9"}, {"name": "Hua Bai", "org": "First People's Hospital of Nanning", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f8ffbe"}, {"name": "Jiangang Ou", "org": "Zhongshan Chenxinghai Hospital", "id": "5b5433e3e1cd8e4e15f3f79c"}, {"name": "Haike Wu", "org": "Foshan Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e1519f8ba"}, {"name": "Zilong Chen", "org": "First People's Hospital of Nanning", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1502517a"}, {"name": "Yane Zhou", "org": "Zhongshan Chenxinghai Hospital", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f7292c"}, {"name": "Saiying Wan", "org": "Foshan Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e1500e4fa"}, {"name": "Yan Hong", "org": "First People's Hospital of Nanning", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15face13"}, {"name": "Jingliang Wang", "org": "Foshan Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1516c8ef"}, {"name": "Minghui Ding", "org": "Sun Yat-Sen University", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1505f241"}, {"name": "Aiwu Zhang", "org": "Sun Yat-Sen University", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151c9ed9"}, {"name": "Daoyuan Zhu", "org": "Continuing Learning College of Guangzhou University", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f5676b"}, {"name": "Yannan Fang", "org": "Sun Yat-Sen University", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e1520afef"}], "title": "Prevalence and burden of headache disorders in two neighboring provinces of China", "keywords": ["Burden", "Neighboring provinces", "Prevalence", "Primary headache"], "venue": "Journal of Clinical Neuroscience", "year": 2014, "abstract": "To our knowledge, studies concerning the prevalence and burden of primary headache in China are limited to specific regions without comparison of different districts.

Mutation analysis reveals that LKB1 inactivation is present in 30% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), indicating its role as a tumor suppressor. However, the molecular mechanism is still not clear. Our study attempted to establish LKB1 stable knockdown NSCLC cell line, detect alterations in gene expression and identify the genes regulated by LKB1. Methods LKB1 stable knockdown H1299 cell line was established using a lentiviral short hairpin RNA. To identify the knockdown effect, LKB1 mRNA and protein expression level were evaluated with quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting. We treated the cell lines with 2-deoxyglucose to determine if LKB1 protein function was impacted. Gene microarray analysis was performed to detect the gene expression alterations in LKB1 stable knockdown H1299 cells. Results LKB1 mRNA and protein expression were significantly suppressed in LKB1 stable knockdown H1299 cell line. 2-DG treatment had little impact on the phosphorylation of AMPK, which is the downstream target of LKB1, indicating the loss of function of LKB1. The microarray data showed that LKB1 knockdown resulted in expression alterations of 1243 kinds of genes, including those involved in cell migration, cell proliferation and cell apoptosis. Conclusions The establishment of LKB1 stable knockdown H1299 cell line provides us with a great tool to investigate various genes regulated by LKB1 through microarray. The discovery of cell proliferation and migration-related genes regulated by LKB1 is critical for unraveling molecular mechanisms of LKB1's role in the development and metastasis of lung cancer.", "pid": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f6b20f"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Zhaorong Zhou", "org": "School of Physics and Electronic Engineering", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1504f6b4"}, {"name": "Tao Jiang", "org": "School of Physics and Electronic Engineering", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e15147584"}, {"name": "Hua Bai", "org": "School of Physics and Electronic Engineering", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e15153986"}, {"name": "Sanshan Sun", "org": "School of Physics and Electronic Engineering", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151b6c4a"}, {"name": "Hong Long", "org": "School of Electrical Engineering and Information", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fb5cc4"}], "title": "Joint optimization of power and decoding order in CDMA based cognitive radio systems with successive interference cancellation", "venue": "International Conference on Communication Technology Proceedings, ICCT", "year": 2011, "abstract": "In the cognitive radio (CR) system, power control is a key enabling technique to ensure quality-of-service (QoS) provisioning for primary users (PUs) and secondary users (SUs). How to efficiently allocate power to SUs is not a trivial work, especially, in CDMA based CR systems with successive interference cancellation (SIC), the number of possible decoding orders grows factorially with the number of users, the problem of power control is a combinatorial optimization and belongs to the category of NP problems, which involves the joint optimization of power allocation and decoding order adjustment, thus the complexity efficient optimal algorithm cannot be found and the suboptimal algorithm should be developed. This paper proposes an efficient joint optimization algorithm of power allocation and decoding order adjustment for addressing this NP problem. In the proposed algorithm, the feasibility of CDMA based CR systems with SIC can be quickly examined. Furthermore, if the CR system is feasible, the power and decoding order of SUs will be efficiently optimized based on the corresponding feasible decoding order. We conduct the extensive simulation experiments, and the numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm. \u00a9 2011 IEEE.", "pid": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150bcf8e"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Xiaoyun Zeng", "org": "Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150cda9f"}, {"name": "Shun Liu", "org": "Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150f0c1b"}, {"name": "Hongping Yu", "org": "Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15119e02"}, {"name": "Long Ji", "org": "Taishan Medical College", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1518a33d"}, {"name": "Longman Li", "org": "Department of AIDS/STD Prevention", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fd6c23"}, {"name": "Jinmei Huang", "org": "Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Center for Disease Prevention and Control", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e1519c14f"}, {"name": "Hua Bai", "org": "Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fc1bd2"}, {"name": "Xiaoqiang Qiu", "org": "Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fe677e"}], "title": "DNA repair capacity, DNA-strand break repair gene polymorphisms, and the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in southwestern Guangxi of China", "venue": "DNA and Cell Biology", "year": 2012, "abstract": "The associations between DNA repair capacity (DRC), DNA repair gene polymorphisms, and the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have not been determined in high-risk areas. The aims of this study were to investigate whether DRC is related to the incidence of HCC and to determine whether polymorphisms in the DNA repair genes that regulate DRC are associated with the risk of HCC. First, a small case-control study was conducted to examine the association between DRC and the incidence of HCC and the environmental and genetic factors regulating DRC. Then, a large case-control study was conducted to determine whether those DNA repair gene polymorphisms shown to regulate DRC were related to the risk of HCC. The median DRC was significantly lower among the cases (0.80) than the controls (0.93). A multivariate linear regression analysis showed that the HBsAg status (p<0.01), ethnicity (p=0.01), and polymorphisms in the XRCC3-241 (p=0.01) and APE1-148 (p=0.03) gene loci may be impact factors for DRC. In the large case-control study, a stratified analysis showed that individuals with the APE1-148-combined genotype GT+TT likely had a significantly higher HCC risk compared with those with only the GG genotype (crude odds ratio=1.93, 95% confidence interval=1.17-3.17) among the Zhuang ethnicity. However, nonsignificant differences were observed between XRCC3-241 polymorphisms and the HCC risk. DRC may be related to the incidence of HCC as determined by environmental and genetic factors found in southwestern part of the Guangxi Province.

In this paper, we adopted quantitative and qualitative methods to analyze the supply-demand situation and price tendency of the world's top three markets in 2013, i. e., North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. First, in supply and demand, gas consumption in North America grew slightly and gas supply was relatively loose; gas consumption in Europe became stabilized after 2010 and supply-demand balance was maintained; gas consumption in the Asia-Pacific market grew slowly but the emerging economies are the strong growth momentum; and natural liquefying power and LNG receiving capacity simultaneously increased, but the trade volume rebounded modestly in the whole world. Second, in terms of price, the average gas price in 2013 in North America and Europe grew dramatically while that in Asia decreased slightly so the price differences between the tope three markets obviously narrowed; but on the other hand, the imported LNG prices in Asia were higher than those in the other markets undertaking the unfair premium. On this basis, we predicted the supply-demand situation and price tendency in 2014 global gas market. The natural gas supply-demand will be maintained steadily but the differences will still exist at different places; gas consumption in North America will be kept at the same level with that in 2013 and the loose supply will tend to be balanced with the demand so the gas price will increase significantly; gas price in Europe will decrease on year-on-year basis due to the weakening economy, stable temperature, etc.; at the condition that the global oil price will be kept at the same level or decrease slightly compared to that in 2013, the imported LNG price in Asia will be maintained stable with a slight decline; and the differences of gas price among the world's top three markets will be further narrowed.", "pid": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f7faec"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Xian-Shuang Meng", "org": "Chinese Academy of Inspection and Quarantine", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150ef870"}, {"name": "Hua Bai", "org": "Chinese Academy of Inspection and Quarantine", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150ceb34"}, {"name": "Qing Zhang", "org": "Chinese Academy of Inspection and Quarantine", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151cd8de"}, {"name": "Qing Lv", "org": "Chinese Academy of Inspection and Quarantine", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e150925b3"}, {"name": "Yun-Xia Chen", "org": "Chinese Academy of Inspection and Quarantine", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151d51a3"}, {"name": "Hui-Juan Ma", "org": "Chinese Academy of Inspection and Quarantine", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150e59f0"}, {"name": "Jing-Rui Li", "org": "Chinese Academy of Inspection and Quarantine", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e15161de0"}, {"name": "Qiang Ma", "org": "Purdue University, Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151cb0ec"}], "title": "Simultaneous determination of 15 nitroimidazoles in cosmetics by HPLC coupled with electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry", "venue": "Journal of AOAC International", "year": 2014, "abstract": "A sensitive and reliable analytical method based on HPLC/MS/MS has been developed for the simultaneous determination of 15 nitroimidazoles in cosmetics.

Methods: Samples were derived from two patient cohorts: (i) 114 early-stage NSCLC who received surgical resection; and (ii) 31 advanced-stage SCC who received EGFR-TKI EGFRvIII. EGFR and V-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) mutations were detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography, and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism, respectively. The associations of EGFRvIII, EGFR, and KRAS mutations with clinical outcome of EGFR-TKI treatment were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method, descriptive analysis, and multi-variable Cox regression analysis.

The molecules of the TVMs were designed based on structure and pharmacological property comparisons among AVM, IVM, and milbemycin (MBM). To produce TVMs, a genetically engineered strain, MHJ1011, was constructed from Streptomyces avermitilis G8-17, an AVM industrial strain. In MHJ1011, the native aveA1 gene was seamlessly replaced with milA1 from Streptomyces hygroscopicus. The total titer of the two TVMs produced by MHJ1011 reached 3,400 mg/liter. Insecticidal tests proved that TVM had enhanced activities against Tetranychus cinnabarinus and Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, as desired.

Traditional frequent itemset mining algorithms have certain limitations. For example Apriori algorithm has to scan the input data repeatedly, which leads to high I/O load and low performance, and the FP-Growth algorithm is limited by the capacity of computer's inner stores because it needs to build a FP-tree and mine frequent itemset on the basis of the FP-tree in memory. With the coming of the Big Data era, these limitations are becoming more prominent when confronted with mining large-scale data. In this paper, DPBM, a distributed matrix-based pruning algorithm based on Spark, is proposed to deal with frequent itemset mining. DPBM can greatly reduce the amount of candidate itemset by introducing a novel pruning technique for matrix-based frequent itemset mining algorithm, an improved Apriori algorithm which only needs to scan the input data once. In addition, each computer node reduces greatly the memory usage by implementing DPBM under a latest distributed environment-Spark, which is a lightning-fast distributed computing. The experimental results show that DPBM have better performance than MapReduce-based algorithms for frequent itemset mining in terms of speed and scalability.", "pid": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e151395d5"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Rui-Ting Feng", "org": "Department of Medical Oncology, People\u2019s Hospital of Zhengzhou", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1508d9d4"}, {"name": "Jia-Zhuan Mei", "org": "Department of Medical Oncology, People\u2019s Hospital of Zhengzhou", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e15181ecf"}, {"name": "Min Li", "org": "Department of Medical Oncology, People\u2019s Hospital of Zhengzhou", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f804ce"}, {"name": "Ji-Zhi Zhao", "org": "Department of Medical Oncology, People\u2019s Hospital of Zhengzhou", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151a6c99"}, {"name": "Hua Bai", "org": "Department of Medical Oncology, People\u2019s Hospital of Zhengzhou", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15015e02"}, {"name": "Gui-Ju Liu", "org": "Department of Medical Oncology, People\u2019s Hospital of Zhengzhou", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f8dc46"}], "title": "Effect of brain-derivedneurotrophic factor on in vitro metastasis of esophageal carcinoma cell line ECa9706", "keywords": ["Brain-derived neurotrophic factor", "Esophageal carcinoma", "Migration", "Proliferation"], "venue": "World Chinese Journal of Digestology", "year": 2015, "abstract": "AIM: To explore the effect of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) on the proliferation and migration of ECa9706 cell line in vitro and the underlying mechanism.

Little is known, however, about the events that act upstream of these signaling pathways. Here, we explore the modulatory effects of hydrogen peroxide (H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>) on these pathways in the context of liver development and regeneration. Results: We show that H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> production during liver development and after partial hepatectomy is tightly regulated in time by specific H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-producing and scavenging proteins and dose dependently triggers two distinct pathways. Sustained elevated H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> levels are required for the activation of ERK signaling and trigger a shift from quiescence to proliferation. Contrastingly, sustained decreased H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> levels are required for the activation of p38 signaling and trigger a shift from proliferation to quiescence. Both events impact the cyclin D and Rb pathways and are involved in liver development and regeneration. Pharmacological lowering of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> levels reduces the extent of fetal hepatocyte proliferation and delays the onset of liver regeneration. Chemical augmentation of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> levels in adult hepatocytes triggers proliferation and delays the termination of liver regeneration.

Oxidative stress is believed to be responsible for the pathological changes in ALD. Previous studies have showed that insulin, a classic regulator of glucose metabolism, has significant anti-oxidative function and plays an important role in maintaining the redox balance. For addressing the effects and mechanisms of insulin pre-administration on ethanol-induced liver oxidative injury, we investigated histopathology, inflammatory factors, apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, antioxidant defense system, ethanol metabolic enzymes and lipid disorder in liver of ethanol-exposed mice pretreatment with insulin or not. There are several novel findings in our study. First, we found insulin pre-administration alleviated acute ethanol exposure-induced liver injury and inflammation reflected by the decrease of serum AST and ALT activities, the improvement of pathological alteration and the inhibition of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 expressions. Second, insulin pre-administration could significantly reduce apoptosis and ameliorate mitochondrial dysfunction in liver of mice exposed to ethanol, supporting by decreasing caspases-3 activities and the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2, increasing mitochondrial viability and mitochondrial oxygen consumption, inhibition of the decline of ATP levels and mitochondrial ROS accumulation. Third, insulin pre-administration prevented ethanol-mediated oxidative stress and enhance antioxidant defense system, which is evaluated by the decline of MDA levels and the rise of GSH/GSSG, the up-regulations of antioxidant enzymes CAT, SOD, GR through Nrf-2 dependent pathway. Forth, the modification of ethanol metabolism pathway such as the inhibition of CYP2E1, the activation of ALDH might be involved in the anti-oxidative and protective effects exerted by insulin pre-administration against acute ethanol exposure in mice. Finally, insulin pre-administration deteriorated hepatic steatosis in mice exposed to ethanol might be through SRBEP-1c activation. In summary, these results indicated that insulin pre-administration effectively alleviated liver oxidative injury through anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic activities but also deteriorated hepatic steatosis through SRBEP-1c activation in mice exposed to ethanol.

However, it is difficult to perform genetic manipulations using the endogenous recombination machinery. In many bacteria, phage recombineering systems have been employed to improve recombineering frequencies. To date, an efficient phage recombineering system for B. subtilis has not been reported. Here, we, for the first time, identified that GP35 from the native phage SPP1 exhibited a high recombination activity in B. subtilis. On this basis, we developed a high-efficiency GP35-meditated recombineering system. Taking single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) as a recombineering substrate, ten recombinases from diverse sources were investigated in B. subtilis W168. GP35 showed the highest recombineering frequency (1.71 \u00b1 0.15 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22121</sup>). Besides targeting the purine nucleoside phosphorylase gene (deoD), we also demonstrated the utility of GP35 and Beta from Escherichia coli lambda phage by deleting the alpha-amylase gene (amyE) and uracil phosphoribosyltransferase gene (upp). In all three genetic loci, GP35 exhibited a higher frequency than Beta. Moreover, a phylogenetic tree comparing the kinship of different recombinase hosts with B. subtilis was constructed, and the relationship between the recombineering frequency and the kinship of the host was further analyzed. The results suggested that closer kinship to B. subtilis resulted in higher frequency in B. subtilis. In conclusion, the recombinase from native phage or prophage can significantly promote the genetic recombineering frequency in its host, providing an effective genetic tool for constructing genetically engineered strains and investigating bacterial physiology.", "pid": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fe65b5"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Jin-Ke Bao", "org": "Department of Physics, Zhejiang University", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f92280"}, {"name": "Lin Li", "org": "Department of Physics, Hangzhou Normal University", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15015094"}, {"name": "Zhang-Tu Tang", "org": "Department of Physics, Zhejiang University", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e15098860"}, {"name": "Yi Liu", "org": "Department of Physics, Zhejiang University", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e15058cff"}, {"name": "Yu-Ke Li", "org": "Department of Physics, Hangzhou Normal University", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e150970d2"}, {"name": "Hua Bai", "org": "Department of Physics, Zhejiang University", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150dfa36"}, {"name": "Chun-Mu Feng", "org": "Department of Physics, Zhejiang University", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15119838"}, {"name": "Zhu-An Xu", "org": "Collaborative Innovation Centre of Advanced Microstructures", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150ef343"}, {"name": "Guang-Han Cao", "org": "Collaborative Innovation Centre of Advanced Microstructures", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150f5334"}], "title": "Cluster spin-glass ground state in quasi-one-dimensional KCr<inf>3</inf>As<inf>3</inf>", "venue": "Physical Review B - Condensed Matter and Materials Physics", "year": 2015, "abstract": "We report structural and physical properties of a new quasi-one-dimensional Cr-based compound, KCr<inf>3</inf>As<inf>3</inf>, which is prepared by potassium deintercalation from the superconductive K<inf>2</inf>Cr<inf>3</inf>As<inf>3</inf>.
