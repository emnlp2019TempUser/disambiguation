The 2D polarization grating makes up of two orthogonal 1D polarization gratings, which were written at the same place by two orthogonally linearly polarized 532 nm beams. It is found that the diffraction efficiency of 2D grating is lower than that of 1D grating, and the 2D grating acts as the integration of its componential 1D gratings. Furthermore, we find that the polarization dependency of diffraction efficiency and the polarization conversions arise from the collaboration of linear and circular birefringence. \u00a9 2009 Chin.

Geese are capable of rapid growth, disease resistance, and high liver lipid storage capacity, and can be easily fed coarse fodder. Here, we sequence and analyze the whole-genome sequence of an economically important goose breed in China and compare it with that of terrestrial bird species. Results: A draft sequence of the whole-goose genome was obtained by shotgun sequencing, and 16,150 protein-coding genes were predicted. Comparative genomics indicate that significant differences occur between the goose genome and that of other terrestrial bird species, particularly regarding major histocompatibility complex, Myxovirus resistance, Retinoic acid-inducible gene I, and other genes related to disease resistance in geese. In addition, analysis of transcriptome data further reveals a potential molecular mechanism involved in the susceptibility of geese to fatty liver disease and its associated symptoms, including high levels of unsaturated fatty acids and low levels of cholesterol. The results of this study show that deletion of the goose lep gene might be the result of positive selection, thus allowing the liver to adopt energy storage mechanisms for long-distance migration. Conclusions: This is the first report describing the complete goose genome sequence and contributes to genomic resources available for studying aquatic birds. The findings in this study are useful not only for genetic breeding programs, but also for studying lipid metabolism disorders.", "pid": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1509cbf7"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Jing Han", "org": "Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciences", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1514190c"}, {"name": "Jinru Li", "org": "Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciences", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f5002a"}, {"name": "Wenfeng Jia", "org": "Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciences", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ffcb56"}, {"name": "Liangming Yao", "org": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Noncoding RNA", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e15138d81"}, {"name": "Xiaoqin Li", "org": "Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciences", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f74013"}, {"name": "Long Jiang", "org": "Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciences", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1507ec57"}, {"name": "Yong Tian", "org": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Noncoding RNA", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151d97bc"}], "title": "Photothermal therapy of cancer cells using novel hollow gold nanoflowers", "keywords": ["AuNFs", "Cancer therapy", "Cytotoxicity", "Endocytosis", "HeLa cells", "NIR"], "venue": "International Journal of Nanomedicine", "year": 2014, "abstract": "This article presents a new strategy for fabricating large gold nanoflowers (AuNFs) that exhibit high biological safety under visible light and very strong photothermal cytotoxicity to HeLa cells under irradiation with near-infrared (NIR) light. This particular type of AuNF was constructed using vesicles produced from a multiamine head surfactant as a template followed by depositing gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and growing their crystallites on the surface of vesicles. The localized surface plasmon-resonance spectrum of this type of AuNF can be easily modulated to the NIR region by controlling the size of the AuNFs. When the size of the AuNFs increased, biosafety under visible light improved and cytotoxicity increased under NIR irradiation. Experiments in vitro with HeLa cells and in vivo with small mice have been carried out, with promising results. The mechanism for this phenomenon is based on the hypothesis that it is difficult for larger AuNFs to enter the cell without NIR irradiation, but they enter the cell easily at the higher temperatures caused by NIR irradiation. We believe that these effects will exist in other types of noble metallic NPs and cancer cells. In addition, the affinity between AuNPs and functional biomolecules, such as aptamers and biomarkers, will make this type of AuNF a good recognition device in cancer diagnosis and therapy. \u00a9 2014 Han et al.", "pid": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fbfbab"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Tao Zeng", "org": "Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine, Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e15178f44"}, {"name": "Liping Zhang", "org": "College of Chemistry and Life Sciences, Zhejiang Normal University", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e151533ff"}, {"name": "Jinjun Li", "org": "Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine, Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fc97e3"}, {"name": "Deqian Wang", "org": "Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine, Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e15136313"}, {"name": "Yong Tian", "org": "Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine, Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151d97bc"}, {"name": "Lizhi Lu", "org": "Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine, Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15000a13"}], "title": "De novo assembly and characterization of Muscovy duck liver transcriptome and analysis of differentially regulated genes in response to heat stress", "keywords": ["Gene expression", "Heat stress", "Muscovy duck", "RNA-seq", "Transcriptome"], "venue": "Cell Stress and Chaperones", "year": 2015, "abstract": "High temperature is a major abiotic stress limiting animal growth and productivity worldwide. The Muscovy duck (Cairina moschata), sometimes called the Barbary drake, is a type of duck with a fairly unusual domestication history. In Southeast Asia, duck meat is one of the top meats consumed, and as such, the production of the meat is an important topic of research. The transcriptomic and genomic data presently available are insufficient to understanding the molecular mechanism underlying the heat tolerance of Muscovy ducks. Thus, transcriptome and expression profiling data for this species are required as important resource for identifying genes and developing molecular marker. In this study, de novo transcriptome assembly and gene expression analysis using Illumina sequencing technology were performed. More than 225 million clean reads were generated and assembled into 36,903 unique transcripts with an average length of 1,135\u00a0bp. A total of 21,221 (57.50\u00a0%) unigenes were annotated. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of the annotated unigenes revealed that the majority of sequenced genes were associated with transcription, signal transduction, and apoptosis. We also performed gene expression profiling analysis upon heat treatment in Muscovy ducks and identified 470 heat-response unique transcripts. GO term enrichment showed that protein folding and chaperone binding were significant enrichment, whereas KEGG pathway analyses showed that Ras and MAPKs were activated after heat stress in Muscovy ducks. Our research enriched sequences information of Muscovy duck, provided novel insights into responses to heat stress in these ducks, and serve as candidate genes or markers that can be used to guide future efforts to breed heat-tolerant duck strains.", "pid": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e15161b83"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Yao Wang", "org": "School of Chemical Engineering", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e15210b85"}, {"name": "Jian Du", "org": "School of Chemical Engineering", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15115489"}, {"name": "Jintao Wu", "org": "School of Chemical Engineering", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15128682"}, {"name": "Gaohong He", "org": "School of Chemical Engineering", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f671be"}, {"name": "Guozhu Kuang", "org": "School of Chemical Engineering", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f96205"}, {"name": "Xishan Fan", "org": "School of Chemical Engineering", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f576e7"}, {"name": "Pingjing Yao", "org": "School of Chemical Engineering", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15faab95"}, {"name": "Shenglin Lu", "org": "Guizhou Chitianhua Group Co., Ltd.", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f6a3ba"}, {"name": "Peiyi Li", "org": "Guizhou Chitianhua Group Co., Ltd.", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151dd612"}, {"name": "Jigang Tao", "org": "Guizhou Chitianhua Group Co., Ltd.", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1502bf61"}, {"name": "Yong Wan", "org": "Guizhou Chitianhua Group Co., Ltd.", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1506b601"}, {"name": "Zhengyang Kuang", "org": "Guizhou Chitianhua Group Co., Ltd.", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151cfdc4"}, {"name": "Yong Tian", "org": "Guizhou Chitianhua Group Co., Ltd.", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fe3296"}], "title": "Application of total process energy-integration in retrofitting an ammonia plant", "keywords": ["Ammonia plant", "Pinch analysis", "Total process energy-integration"], "venue": "Applied Energy", "year": 2003, "abstract": "A case study of total process energy-integration in a commercial ammonia plant was performed using a modified pinch analysis.

It was observed that the dipole moment of anti-solvent and the supersaturation were related to the variations in polymorphic form. The metastable form \u03b2 always was precipitated initially in high polarity anti-solvent or in high supersaturation case, and then transformed to the stable form \u03b5 by solution mediated process, which obeyed the Ostwald's rule of stages. A new acetone solvate was isolated in acetone solution, which was so unstable that it quickly desolated to obtain form \u03b2.

A concept of the critical aggregation concentration (CAC) of active molecules is proposed to describe the physical configuration before the formation of a nucleus during vapor-liquid phase transition. All active molecules exist as monomers when the concentration of active molecules is lower than CAC, while the active molecules will generate aggregation once the concentration of the active molecules reaches CAC. However, these aggregates with aggregation number, N, smaller than five can steadily exist in bulk phase. The other excess active molecules can only produce infinite aggregation and form a critical nucleus of vapor-liquid phase transition. Without any outer perturbation the state point of CAC corresponds to the critical superheated or supercooled state. Meanwhile, a model of two-region structure of a nucleus is proposed to describe nucleus evolution. The interfacial tension between bulk liquid phase and nucleus is dependent of the density gradient in the transition region and varies with the structure change of the transition region.

One advantage of this method is that it does not need complicated matrix operations, so the computation cost can be reduced. As a key step in design of the nonlinear observer, the state-space equations based on the equivalent circuit model are derived. The Lyapunov stability theory is employed to prove the convergence of the nonlinear observer. Four experiments are carried out to evaluate the performance of the presented method. The results show that the SOC estimation error converges to 3% within 130 s while the initial SOC error reaches 20%, and does not exceed 4.5% while the measurement suffers both 2.5% voltage noise and 5% current noise.

However, it is difficult to get an accurate SOC, because its value cannot be directly measured and is affected by various factors, such as the operating temperature, current rate and cycle number. In this paper, a modified equivalent circuit model is presented to include the impact of different current rates and SOCs on the battery internal resistance, and the impact of different temperatures and current rates on the battery capacity. Besides, a linear-averaging method is presented to calculate the internal resistance and practical capacity correction factors according to data collected from the experimental bench and saved as look-up tables. The unscented Kalman filter (UKF) algorithm is then introduced to estimate the SOC according to the presented model.

The second-order resistor-capacitor (2RC) equivalent circuit model is used to simulate the dynamic behaviors of a LIB, based on which the state equations are derived to design the AGNO for SOC estimation.

The arsenic species, i.e., arsenate (As(V)), arsenite (As(III)), monomethylarsonic acid (MMA), dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) and trimethylarsine oxide (TMAO), were separated on C30-5 columns, and the concept of gradient hydride generation facilitates high conversion efficiency of the arsenic species into corresponding hydrides. The use of 2% L-cysteine in the GHG process gives rise to further improvements on the hydride generation efficiency of 13% to 32% for the arsenic species. The hydrides were separated in a unique design of gas-liquid separator, which not only ensures a complete separation but minimizes the dispersion of hydrides when delivering into the atomizer, resulting in a maximum of 13-fold improvement on the sensitivity of As(V) compared to previous studies. A separation process was finished within 800 s by injecting 100 L sample solution, achieving detection limits of 0.9, 1.4, 1.4, 1.6, 1.5 g/L, respectively, for As(V), As(III), MMA, DMA and TMAO.

Methods: A prospective study was conducted in patients who received Codman ICP monitoring in the neurosurgical department from January 2010 to December 2011. According to the location of sensors, the patients were categorized into two groups: intraventricular group and subdural group. Zero drift between the two groups and its association with the duration of ICP monitor were analyzed. Results: Totally, 22 patients undergoing intraventricular ICP monitoring and 27 receiving subdural ICP monitoring were enrolled. There was no significant difference in duration of ICP monitoring, zero drift value and its absolute value between intraventricular and subdural groups (5.38 d\u00b1 2.58dvs4.58d\u00b12.24d,0.77mm Hg\u00b12.18mm Hgvsl.03mmHg\u00b1 2.06 mm Hg, 1.68 mm Hg\u00b11.55mm Hgvs 1.70 mm Hg\u00b11.53mm Hg, respectively; all P>0.05). Absolute value of zero drift in both groups significantly rose with the increased duration of ICP monitoring (P<0.05) while zero drift value did not.

One primary success of TeVeS is that it provides an enhancement of gravitational lensing, which could not be achieved by other MOND theories. Following Bekenstein's work, we investigate the phenomena of gravitational lensing including deflection angles, lens equations, and time delay. We find that the deflection angle maintains its value, while the distance of closest approach varies in the MOND regime. We also use the deflection angle law to derive magnifications and investigate microlensing light curves. We find that the difference in the magnification of the two images in the point-mass model is not a constant, as in general relativity (GR). Besides, microlensing light curves could deviate significantly from GR in the deep MOND regime. Furthermore, the scalar field, which is introduced to enhance the deflection angle in TeVeS, contributes a negative effect on the potential time delay. Unfortunately, this phenomenon is unmeasurable in lensing systems, where we can only observe the time delay between two images for a given source. However, this measurable time delay offers another constraint on the mass ratio of the dark matter and MOND scenarios, which in general differs from that given by the deflection angle.

The system's feasibility and capability is demonstrated through a case study of forecasting 1-day ahead flow in a river basin located in China. The encouraging simulation results show that the system can simplify the process of implementing hydrological forecast. \u00a9 IWA Publishing 2013.", "pid": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e15094ec5"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Mu-Tao Huang", "org": "School of Hydropower and Information Engineering", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151f6e1b"}, {"name": "Yong Tian", "org": "School of Hydropower and Information Engineering", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f84e96"}], "title": "Three-dimensional lake hydrodynamic numerical modeling and its application to Lake Donghu", "keywords": ["3D GIS", "Finite volume method", "Lake", "Numerical modeling", "Three-dimensional hydrodynamic", "Unstructured grid"], "venue": "Shuidonglixue Yanjiu yu Jinzhan/Chinese Journal of Hydrodynamics Ser.

The numerical computational domain consists of non-overlapping unstructured triangular grids, while irregular bathymetry is represented in the vertical plane with a sigma-stretched vertical coordinate. The spatial discretization schemes of 3D hydrodynamic equations are conducted by using finite volume method. The horizontal momentum equations and the continuity equation on unstructured triangular grids are approximated using an external-internal mode splitting method. The external mode solution is solved by using a modified fourth-order Runge-Kutta time-stepping scheme to calculate the two-dimensional surface elevation field and the depth averaged velocities, and applying the Osher's scheme to compute numerical flux across the boundary of triangular elements in horizontal direction. The model's internal momentum equation solution is solved numerically using a simple combined explicit and implicit scheme to get precise 3D flow details. Furthermore, the GIS techniques are introduced to aid the pre-and pro data processing involved in the numerical modeling tasks. The 3D lake flow structure and movement of Lake Donghu under the different metrology conditions are taken as test cases to demonstrate the effectiveness of the 3D lake hydrodynamic numerical modeling.", "pid": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1502ac32"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Hao Li", "org": "Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Department of Electronics and Information Engineering", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150cc55f"}, {"name": "Yong Ma", "org": "Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Department of Electronics and Information Engineering", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e151949e9"}, {"name": "Kun Liang", "org": "Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Department of Electronics and Information Engineering", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151cf8d1"}, {"name": "Yong Tian", "org": "Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Department of Electronics and Information Engineering", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f84e96"}, {"name": "Rui Wang", "org": "Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Department of Electronics and Information Engineering", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151aeee9"}], "title": "Parameters optimization for wavelet denoising based on normalized spectral angle and threshold constraint machine learning", "keywords": ["hyperspectral", "machine learning", "parameters optimization", "wavelet denoising"], "venue": "Journal of Applied Remote Sensing", "year": 2012, "abstract": "Wavelet parameters (e.g., wavelet type, level of decomposition) affect the performance of the wavelet denoising algorithm in hyperspectral applications. Current studies select the best wavelet parameters for a single spectral curve by comparing similarity criteria such as spectral angle (SA). However, the method to find the best parameters for a spectral library that contains multiple spectra has not been studied. In this paper, a criterion named normalized spectral angle (NSA) is proposed. By comparing NSA, the best combination of parameters for a spectral library can be selected. Moreover, a fast algorithm based on threshold constraint and machine learning is developed to reduce the time of a full search. After several iterations of learning, the combination of parameters that constantly surpasses a threshold is selected. The experiments proved that by using the NSA criterion, the SA values decreased significantly, and the fast algorithm could save 80% time consumption, while the denoising performance was not obviously impaired. \u00a9 2012 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).", "pid": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15feb84b"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Yong Tian", "org": "Department of Chemistry", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150cd97e"}, {"name": "Ya-Pan Wu", "org": "Department of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f75979"}, {"name": "Dong-Sheng Li", "org": "Department of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151e333a"}, {"name": "Hui Wang", "org": "Department of Chemistry", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e15151f77"}, {"name": "Ji-Wu Wang", "org": "Department of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150a11d4"}], "title": "Catena-Poly[[tetra-aqua-(\u03bc-4,4\u2032-bipyridine-\u03ba2 N:N\u2032)zinc(II)] fumarate tetra-hydrate]", "venue": "Acta Crystallographica Section E: Structure Reports Online", "year": 2008, "abstract": "In the title compound, {[Zn(C10H8N2)(H2O)4](C4H2O4)\u00b74H2O} n , the Zn", "pid": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fbd58e"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Xiao-Fang Wang", "org": "Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Physico-inorganic Chemistry", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e151709b1"}, {"name": "Hui Wang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Continental Dynamics", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e15151f77"}, {"name": "Yong Tian", "org": "Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Physico-inorganic Chemistry", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150cd97e"}, {"name": "Fa-Xin Dong", "org": "Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Physico-inorganic Chemistry", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e15179c1c"}, {"name": "Qi-Zhen Shi", "org": "Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Physico-inorganic Chemistry", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fbaf22"}, {"name": "Zhen-Yi Wen", "org": "Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Physico-inorganic Chemistry", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1519322c"}], "title": "Studies on hydrogen storage properties of a new material-modified Fe3O4 ", "keywords": ["Cyclic stability", "Hydrogen storage material", "Hydrogen storage property", "Modified Fe3O4"], "venue": "Acta Chimica Sinica", "year": 2007, "abstract": "Modified Fe", "pid": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1507c736"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Yong Tian", "org": "College of Animal Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151d97bc"}, {"name": "Lizhi Lu", "org": "Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Science", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15000a13"}, {"name": "Yan Fu", "org": "Laboratory of Animal Genetics", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151aa84e"}, {"name": "Jin Zhao", "org": "College of Animal Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15119ab5"}, {"name": "Cun Zhang", "org": "Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Science", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1507ed2b"}, {"name": "Qingyan Yuan", "org": "Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Science", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e1510524e"}, {"name": "Junda Shen", "org": "Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Science", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f50561"}], "title": "Assignment of Dicer gene to chicken chromosome 5 by radiation hybrid panel mapping", "venue": "Biochemical Genetics", "year": 2007, "pid": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fe124e"}, {"authors": [{"name": "You-Qiong Li", "org": "Department of Human Anatomy", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fa62a5"}, {"name": "Liang Xu", "org": "Department of Human Anatomy", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e15165f36"}, {"name": "Rui-Fen Li", "org": "Department of Human Anatomy", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e150411b9"}, {"name": "Yong Tian", "org": "Department of Human Anatomy", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151d97bc"}, {"name": "Yu Chen", "org": "Department of Human Anatomy", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e150482ed"}, {"name": "Hai-Jun Zhang", "org": "Department of Human Anatomy", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150ce570"}, {"name": "Li-Zhen Qiu", "org": "Department of Human Anatomy", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1511be78"}, {"name": "Xue-Feng Li", "org": "Department of Human Anatomy", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e15196952"}], "title": "Three-dimensional reconstruction of lenticular nucleus and determination of its centroid and volume", "keywords": ["Centroid", "Corpus striatum", "Three-dimensional reconstruction"], "venue": "Journal of Jilin University Medicine Edition", "year": 2007, "abstract": "Objective: To get the three-dimensional images and determine the data of the centroid and the volume of the lenticular nucleus (putamen and pallidus included).

Constitutively activated transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) promotes the survival of a number of human tumors. In this study, we investigated the relative efficacies of attenuated S. typhimurium alone or combined with Stat3-specific small interfering RNA( siRNA) in terms of tumor growth and metastasis. The bacteria preferentially homed into tumors over normal liver and spleen tissues in vivo. S. typhimurium expressing plasmid-based Stat3-specific siRNAs significantly inhibited tumor growth, reduced the number of metastastic organs, and extended the life time for C57BL6 mice bearing an implanted prostate tumor, versus bacterial treatment alone.

In addition, we detected the gene expression and distribution of chicken NDRG1 and 3 in seven tissues, including heart, liver, spleen, lung, muscle, brain, and thymus, by RT-PCR, and found that NDRG1 is relatively ubiquitously expressed in all the tested tissues and highly expressed in heart and liver, whereas NDRG3 is high in heart, muscle, and brain. \u00a9 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.", "pid": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e15167021"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Jindong Ren", "org": "Zhejiang Province Academic Agriculture Science", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150e8958"}, {"name": "Lizhi Lu", "org": "Zhejiang Province Academic Agriculture Science", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15000a13"}, {"name": "Xiaolin Liu", "org": "College of Animal Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fb9194"}, {"name": "Zhengrong Tao", "org": "Zhejiang Province Academic Agriculture Science", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e150718df"}, {"name": "Congcong Zhang", "org": "Animal Science Department", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1503859a"}, {"name": "Deqian Wang", "org": "Zhejiang Province Academic Agriculture Science", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e15136313"}, {"name": "Junda Shen", "org": "Zhejiang Province Academic Agriculture Science", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f50561"}, {"name": "Weimeng Liu", "org": "Animal Science Department", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e1520b91d"}, {"name": "Yong Tian", "org": "Zhejiang Province Academic Agriculture Science", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151d97bc"}, {"name": "Zhigang Zhu", "org": "Shaoxing Duck Original Farm", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f50e24"}], "title": "Paternity assessment: Application on estimation of breeding value in body-weight at first egg trait of egg-laying duck (Anas platyrhynchos)", "keywords": ["Anas platyrhynchos", "Estimated breeding value", "Microsatellite loci", "Paternity"], "venue": "Molecular Biology Reports", "year": 2009, "abstract": "Paternity index was analyzed using five microsatellite loci among Chinese egg-laying ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).

These results demonstrate that a diet enriched with different FAs has strong effects on serum lipid levels and the deposition of PUFAs into tissue lipids. \u00a9 Zhejiang University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.", "pid": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ffc1e6"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Fang Wang", "org": "Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Science", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f976f2"}, {"name": "Lizhi Lu", "org": "Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Science", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15000a13"}, {"name": "Hao Yuan", "org": "Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Science", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151cfd6f"}, {"name": "Yong Tian", "org": "Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Science", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151d97bc"}, {"name": "Jinjun Li", "org": "Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Science", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fc97e3"}, {"name": "Junda Shen", "org": "Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Science", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f50561"}, {"name": "Zhengrong Tao", "org": "Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Science", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e150718df"}, {"name": "Yan Fu", "org": "College of Animal Sciences", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151aa84e"}], "title": "cDNA cloning, characterization and expression analysis of toll-like receptor 4 gene in goose", "keywords": ["Expression", "Over-feeding goose", "Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)"], "venue": "Canadian Journal of Animal Science", "year": 2011, "abstract": "Wang, F., Lu, L., Yuan, H., Tian, Y., Li, J., Shen, J., Tao, Z. and Fu, Y. 2011. cDNA cloning, characterization and expression analysis of toll-like receptor 4 gene in goose.

Twenty-nine linear measurements and five ratios were collected from 113 Chinese adult males and 97 Chinese adult females using digital three-dimensional anthropometry methods. By using discriminant analysis, we found that 23 linear measurements and two ratios identified sexual dimorphism (P< 0.01), with predictive accuracy ranging from 57.1% to 86.6%. Using a stepwise method of discriminant function analysis, we found three dimensions predicted sex with 88.6% accuracy: (a) upper end-plate width (EPWu), (b) left pedicle height (PHl), and (c) middle end-plate depth (EPDm). This study shows that a single first lumber vertebra can be used for this purpose, and that the discriminant equation will help forensic determination of sex in the Chinese population. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.", "pid": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151e2d6d"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Ai-Xia Huang", "org": "Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151cbcc6"}, {"name": "Jin-Jun Li", "org": "Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fc97e3"}, {"name": "Jun-Da Shen", "org": "Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f50561"}, {"name": "Zheng-Rong Tao", "org": "Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e150718df"}, {"name": "Jin-Dong Ren", "org": "Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150e8958"}, {"name": "Guo-Qing Li", "org": "Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e151f8b7c"}, {"name": "De-Qian Wang", "org": "Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e15136313"}, {"name": "Yong Tian", "org": "Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151d97bc"}, {"name": "Fu-Sheng Yang", "org": "Xiaoshan East Sea Limited Company", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fa2d89"}, {"name": "Wei-Ping Ding", "org": "Jun-deli Poulty Company of Zhejiang", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1509e9c9"}, {"name": "Tian-Xing Wu", "org": "College of Animal Sciences", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fae728"}, {"name": "Li-Zhi Lu", "org": "Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15000a13"}], "title": "Effects of crossbreeding on slaughter traits and breast muscle chemical composition in Chinese chickens", "keywords": ["Amino acid", "Chicken", "Crossbreeding", "Fatty acid", "Inosine-5\u2032-monophosphate", "Intramuscular fat", "Slaughter traits"], "venue": "Revista Brasileira de Ciencia Avicola", "year": 2011, "abstract": "We investigated the effects of crossbreeding on slaughter traits and the chemical composition of chicken breast muscle.

Together, the identification of Fis1 degradation by DJ-1 signalling in the regulation of oxidative stress-induced neuronal cell death supplies a novel mechanism of DJ-1 in neuronal protection with the implication of DJ-1 in a potential therapeutic avenue for PD. \u00a9 The Authors Journal compilation \u00a9 2012 Biochemical Society.", "pid": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e151f84d1"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Jun He", "org": "College of Animal Sciences", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150ae189"}, {"name": "Yong Tian", "org": "Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Science", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151d97bc"}, {"name": "Jinjun Li", "org": "Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Science", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fc97e3"}, {"name": "Junda Shen", "org": "Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Science", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f50561"}, {"name": "Zhengrong Tao", "org": "Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Science", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e150718df"}, {"name": "Yan Fu", "org": "College of Animal Sciences", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151aa84e"}, {"name": "Dong Niu", "org": "College of Animal Sciences", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e1520ea3e"}, {"name": "Lizhi Lu", "org": "Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Science", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15000a13"}], "title": "Expression pattern of L-FABP gene in different tissues and its regulation of fat metabolism-related genes in duck", "keywords": ["Duck", "Fat metabolism-related gene", "L-FABP", "Oleic acid", "SiRNA"], "venue": "Molecular Biology Reports", "year": 2013, "abstract": "Liver fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP) is a member of intracellular lipid-binding proteins responsible for the transportation of fatty acids.

Methods: The initial operating plane (IOP) was reconstructed by computed tomography angiography (CTA) images, which was perpendicular to the sagittal plane and passed through the sphenoid sinus opening and the pituitary fossa midpoint plane. Three-dimensional coordinate system was selected, the origin was the center of the sphenoid sinus opening, the x-axis and the mirror body (sphenoid external) were overlapping and parallel to the sagittal plane, the z-axis was perpendicular to the sagittal plane, the y-axis was perpendicular to the x-and z-axes.

Even though there are some landmarks for internal carotid artery (ICA) on the wall of the sphenoid sinus, it is not rare to get the artery injured during surgery. We found that the most important landmark, carotid prominence, matched with ICA in merely 37.5% of subjects. In order to find a simple method to locate the artery, we made an anatomical measurement of the ICA and placed the results in a 3-dimensional coordinate system. The sphenoid sinus opening is both the center of the endoscope entry in the anterior sinus wall and the origin of the coordinate system containing 3 orthogonal axes: x, y, and z. The x axis follows the body of the endoscope(out of the sphenoid sinus) parallel to the sagittal plane while z is perpendicular to the sagittal plane. Most of the measurements were obtained in the initial operative plane, which is perpendicular to the sagittal plane and contains the sinus opening and the midpoint of the pituitary fossa. We calculated the coordinates of the midpoint of the pituitary fossa and 4 ICA-related points. The depth of an ICA and the distance between 2 ICAs are also helpful in locating ICA. According to our operation method, all the projective points of the medial edge of ICA on the posterior wall of the sphenoid sinus are lateral to the sphenoid sinus opening, and operating within 0Y25 degrees medial to the endoscope body is believed to be safe from ICA injury.

Comparison of amino acid sequences of HSP60 revealed ApHSP60 is highly conserved, especially in the domains of classical HSP60 family signatures. ApHSP60 transcripts were at low expression levels throughout embryo development. ApHSP60 transcripts were constitutively expressed in all tested tissues of untreated laying duck, with a maximum level in the liver. Fluorescent real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was applied to determine ApHSP60 expression after exposure to different thermal shocks. Under long term treatment with both 30\u00b0C and 35\u00b0C, ApHSP60 transcripts in heart and liver were significantly up-regulated. Otherwise, ApHSP60 transcripts were remarkably down-regulated in heart and liver under acute challenge with 40\u00b0C (a fatal temperature for laying duck). A time-dependent expression pattern of ApHSP60 was found in the recovery period after heat shock reaction. ApHSP60 expression levels in liver and heart were immediately up-regulated to the maximum at 1 h post-challenge, and then decreased to pre-challenge levels by 2 h and 3 h post-challenge, respectively.

There were many reports about the primary event of internal carotid artery injury resulting in hemorrhage during transsphenoidal resection of pituitary tumors. The anatomical relationship between CSICA and the structures in the sella region around can explain its mechanism. Purpose: We study the CSICA and its positional relationship to some stationary structures in the sellar region to locate CSICA and prevent it from injuring in the process of transsphenoidal surgery. Material and Methods: Computed topographic angiography images of 144 internal carotid arteries in individuals were reviewed. The distance from CSICA to midpoint of sella bottom (SB) and the angle between line BA and line BM were measured in the coronal plane, which is across the middle point of SB. The vertical distance from the anterior curve segment of CSICA to the top edge of the sphenoid sinus was measured in people with sphenoid sinus of types III and IV. The horizontal distance between the midpoint of the posterior curve segment and the coronal middle line of SB was measured in the sagittal plane after multiplanar reformation. Results: The mean (SD) distances from the CSICA to the midpoint of SB were 11.25 (3.35) mm in the right and 11.06 (2.98) mm in the left, and the mean (SD) angles between line BA and line BM were 74.2 (2.16) degrees in the right and 73.5 (2.33) degrees in the left. The mean (SD) vertical distance between the anterior curve segment of the CSICA and the top edge of the sphenoid sinus was -0.62 (0.96) mm, the mean (SD) of the right side was -0.68 (1.24) mm, and the mean (SD) of the left was -0.54 (1.15) mm. The mean (SD) horizontal distance between the midpoint of PS segment and the coronal middle line of SB was 6.41 (1.94) mm in the right and 6.31 (1.33) mm in the left. Conclusions: The data in our study are valuable for surgeons in real clinical practice to achieve the best possible surgical outcome and maximize safety, and they also contribute to the understanding of the anatomy of CSICA and the structures around.

Results: The angle between 2 lines that are from the sphenoidal rostrum to the middle point of tuberculum sellae and to the tangential point of a tangent which is through the center of sphenoidal rostrum to the pituitary fossa (AR) was 30.62 \u00b1 4.70 degrees; the angle between 2 lines that are from the unilateral sphenoidal rostrum to the bilateral nearest point of the 2 internal carotid arteries within the area of sellar region (AI) was 39.06 \u00b1 9.82 degrees; the antero-posterior diameter of the pituitary fossa (SP) was 11.07 \u00b1 1.36 mm; the vertical diameter of the pituitary fossa (BH) was 7.20 \u00b1 1.46 mm; the distance from the middle point of tuberculum sellae to the lowest point of the pituitary (SB) was 9.59 \u00b1 1.37 mm; the angle between line SB and the horizontal plane (ASB) was 49.29 \u00b1 7.51 mm; the width of tuberculum sellae was (SD) 10.16 \u00b1 1.47 mm; the width of the intermediate part of the pituitary fossa was (BD) 12.09 \u00b1 2.01 mm; the width of the posterior wall of the pituitary fossa (PD) was 12.84 \u00b1 1.57 mm; and the ply of the bone of the front (PB) and bottom (PA) of pituitary fossa were 0.75 \u00b1 0.22 mm and 0.91 \u00b1 0.26 mm, respectively. Conclusions: These measurements can help to understand the complicated anatomical structures around the pituitary fossae and can contribute to ensure the efficiency and success of the surgery as well.

The plane perpendicular to the line between the superior border of meatus acusticus externus and supraorbital margin was named the base plane. Parameters of 150 patients (300 observations) with healthy middle ears were measured on high-resolution spiral multislice computed tomographic multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) images that were parallel to the base plane. Geniculate ganglion was considered as the beginning of HFN. The shortest distances between HFN and head of malleus (HM), neck of malleus (NM), short limb of incus (SI), long limb of incus (LI), and stapes (S) were measured respectively on different MPR images. The data gained were analyzed by statistical method and were also analyzed with respect to side and gender. On average, HFN-HM was 0.6546 cm, HFN-NM was 0.3680 cm, HFN-SI was 0.2731 cm, HFN-LI was 0.2275 cm, and HFN-S was 0.2162 cm. HFN-NM and HFN-SI were longer on the right side than those of the left (P < 0.05). HFN-SI and HFN-LI were longer in males than those of females on the right side (P < 0.05). Otosteon is considered an excellent bone landmark which easily showed on computed tomographic images and can easily be found in facial nerve decompression. Otosteon could be used to find the location of HFN during surgery. Furthermore, facial nerve localization is the key to facial nerve decompression. Our results may provide more detailed information to predict the location of HFN during facial nerve decompression. Copyright \u00a9 2013 by Mutaz B.

Based on the whole-head magnetic resonance imaging scans of 119 healthy subjects (57 men and 62 women) anonymously, three-dimensional reconstructions were rebuilt. The results of the study are as follows: M is the common midpoint of anterior and inferior border of anterior commissure. O and P are the midpoint of the anterior border of the pituitary stalk's superior and inferior extremity, respectively. The distance between M and O (D1) was 12.42 (SD, 2.35) mm. The distance between M and P (D2) was 22.47 (SD, 2.57) mm. The length of the pituitary stalk (D3) was 10.68 (SD, 2.34) mm. The widest diameter of the pituitary stalk (D4) was 2.78 (SD, 0.50) mm. The inclination of the pituitary stalk at the coronal plane (A1) was 2.73 (SD, 2.60) degrees. Of the 119 pituitary stalks involved in this study, 14.29% were centered, 47.06% inclined to the left with the value (A1L) of 3.41 (SD, 2.58) degrees and 38.66% inclined to the right with the value (A1R) of 2.93 (SD, 2.49) degrees. The angle between MO and MP(A2) was 11.81 (SD, 4.76) degrees. No statistical difference was found between male and female subjects for all the measurements (P > 0.05). With the parameters measured in this study, we can locate the pituitary stalk by anterior commissure; thus, it is relatively safe to do the craniopharyngioma surgery through frontobasal interhemispheric approach when the pituitary stalk cannot be seen clearly because of the shelter of tumor, which will reduce both the unnecessary damage to the pituitary stalk and the probability of postoperative complications.

We demonstrate that SPOP, which encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase component, is a direct transcriptional target of HIFs in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Furthermore, hypoxia results in cytoplasmic accumulation of SPOP, which is sufficient to induce tumorigenesis. This tumorigenic activity occurs through the ubiquitination and degradation of multiple regulators of cellular proliferation and apoptosis, including the tumor suppressor PTEN, ERK phosphatases, the proapoptotic molecule Daxx, and the Hedgehog pathway transcription factor Gli2. Knockdown of SPOP specifically kills ccRCC cells, indicating that it may be a promising therapeutic target. Collectively, our results indicate that SPOP serves as a regulatory hub to promote ccRCC tumorigenesis. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc.", "pid": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f62b79"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Hao Yu Zhu", "org": "Department of Thyroid Surgery, Sino-Japanese Friendship Hospital, Jilin University", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ff2797"}, {"name": "Jun Mei Zhao", "org": "Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital, Jilin University", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15002004"}, {"name": "Ming Yang", "org": "Department of Anatomy, Changchun Medical College", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150d2273"}, {"name": "Chang Li Xia", "org": "Department of Anatomy, College of Basic Medicine, Jilin University", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f4c775"}, {"name": "You Qiong Li", "org": "Department of Anatomy, College of Basic Medicine, Jilin University", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1507df23"}, {"name": "Hui Sun", "org": "Department of Thyroid Surgery, Sino-Japanese Friendship Hospital, Jilin University", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e15169b61"}, {"name": "Yi Qun Zhang", "org": "Cancer Center of The First Affiliated Hospital, Jilin University", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f76666"}, {"name": "Yong Tian", "org": "Department of Anatomy, College of Basic Medicine, Jilin University", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151d97bc"}], "title": "Relative location of foramen ovale, foramen lacerum, and foramen spinosum in hartel pathway", "keywords": ["Blood vessel injury", "Foramen lacerum", "Foramen spinosum", "Hartel pathway", "Trigeminal neuralgia treatment"], "venue": "Journal of Craniofacial Surgery", "year": 2014, "abstract": "Trigeminal neuralgia is a common disease in Chinese people. Minimal invasive transforaminal pathway is widely used in treating trigeminal neuralgia. The Hartel pathway is the most commonly used operation route, but it has potential to injure vessels such as arteria meningea media and the internal carotid artery. We measured the location of operation route, foramen spinosum, and foramen lacerum in a three-dimensional pattern. We found that to protect those 2 vessels, the angle and depth of puncture should be well regulated. The horizontal component of the angle between the needle axis and y axis should be more than 22 degrees in women and 20 degrees in men to avoid the injury of arteria meningea media. And for protecting the internal carotid artery, the depth of puncture should be less than 85 mm for women and 93 mm for men, or less than 9 mm after penetrating the meninges. \u00a9 2014 Mutaz B.

For this approach, the pharyngeal tubercle is an important landmark to identify the midline. The foramen lacerum, another important anatomic area where some crucial structures pass, is close to the pharyngeal tubercle. In the current study, we measured relevant distances and angles on 120 adults without brain diseases to estimate the safety range of the transoral approach. Distances between the pharyngeal tubercle and the foramen lacerum were expressed as mean (SD) and 95% confidence interval. Angles between the straight lines, which pass through the pharyngeal tubercle and the foramen lacerum, and the sagittal plane, as well as the horizontal plane, were also presented as mean (SD) and 95% confidence interval. As regards the 95% confidence intervals of the angles and the distances, which were used to define the safety range, no differences were observed between the right side and the left side. During such surgeries, if the midline is defined as a datum line, it is less likely for surgeons to destroy adjacent structures when moving within 36.30 degrees on the sagittal plane and 45.00 degrees on the horizontal plane once they find the pharyngeal tubercle. It is also safe to move within 16.20 mm from the pharyngeal tubercle. With these data, we have successfully defined the safety range of the surgery, which may help operators choose proper instruments in surgery and avoid injuries to important structures. Moreover, operators may use these data to position the pharyngeal tubercle so as not to deviate from the midline. \u00a9 2014 Mutaz B.

Different RF/PP eco-materials have been fabricated by varying the fiber length, fiber content and way of fiber pre-treatment. This paper studied the mechanical properties of the fabricated RF/PP composites in depth by investigating the mechanical behaviors of RF/PP and microstructures of the ruptured surfaces. The results show that the increases of fiber length and fiber content can improve the tensile strength, flexural strength and compression strength apparently, but result in negative influences on the impact strength and elongation behaviors of RF/PP composites. The optimal addition amount of ramie fiber is around 20 wt%. The pre-treatment of ramie fiber in 10%-15% NaOH is good to the mechanical properties of RF/PP. The fiber length can be varied in the range of 3-8 mm.

A scaling exponential of n=1.59 in \u03c3xy \u223c \u03c3 xx n between the Hall and longitudinal conductivities is obtained for the well-crystallized sample, which fits well with the recent developed universal scaling theory characterized by n=1.6 in the dirty limit.

To address the scalability problem, rather than compositing the video in the gradient-domain pixel by pixel, we perform the video compositing in a reduced space using octree data structure, which significantly reduces the variables. We show that the proposed octree approach is efficient in both seamless and mixing gradient-domain video compositing. Our method enables to perform video compositing in greatly reduced computational time and memory space, while receiving visually identical results with that computed from the full solution. \u00a9 2009 IEEE.", "pid": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f97d8b"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Hong He", "org": "Tianjin University of Technology", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1508fb51"}, {"name": "Ying He", "org": "Tianjin University of Technology", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fa6919"}, {"name": "Baofeng Zhang", "org": "Tianjin University of Technology", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150b2440"}, {"name": "Dajian Zhang", "org": "Research Institute of Measure Technology", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15facbd4"}, {"name": "Yong Tian", "org": "Research Institute of Measure Technology", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ff743d"}, {"name": "Kexi Wang", "org": "Research Institute of Measure Technology", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15121bee"}, {"name": "Hui Meng", "org": "Research Institute of Measure Technology", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150bceca"}, {"name": "Mingfeng Hou", "org": "Research Institute of Measure Technology", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ff8dda"}], "title": "Application of smart antenna interference suppression techniques in TD-SCDMA systems", "venue": "6th International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery, FSKD 2009", "year": 2009, "abstract": "The quality of mobile communications have been severely affected by interference among users in TD-SCDMA, in allusion to this problem, the smart antenna adaptive beam-forming algorithm are researched deeply in the thesis.

At last, through the computing and simulation experiments of true-color images, we confirm that the dual kernel has the validity of tolerating random noise and mixture noise. \u00a9 2010 IEEE.", "pid": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e150478fe"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Nai-Qin Feng", "org": "School of Information Engineering, Zhengzhou University of Industrial Technology", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1511ad21"}, {"name": "Yong Tian", "org": "Department of Information Engineering, He'nan Mechanical and Electrical Vocational College", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f6f497"}, {"name": "Xian-Fang Wang", "org": "College of Computer and Information Engineering, He'nan Normal University", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1518052c"}, {"name": "Li-Ming Song", "org": "College of Computer and Information Engineering, He'nan Normal University", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fd6f1c"}, {"name": "Hai-Ju Fan", "org": "College of Computer and Information Engineering, He'nan Normal University", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e15202535"}, {"name": "Shuang-Xi Wang", "org": "College of Computer Science and Technology, Shangqiu University", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e150586ac"}], "title": "Logarithmic and exponential morphological associative memories", "keywords": ["Autoassociative memories", "Exponent", "Heteroassociative memories", "Logarithm", "Morphological associative memories", "Perfect recall"], "venue": "Ruan Jian Xue Bao/Journal of Software", "year": 2015, "abstract": "A novel morphological associative memory method, abbreviated as LEMAM, is constructed by using logarithmic operator and exponential operator.

The fractal dimension of three kinds of concrete pore at different pore diameter range were determined by MIP(mereury intrusion porosimetry) before and after salt freezing and were studied in a comparative way. The research shows that the fractal dimension of pore diameter at range of 50nm \u223c 550nm after salt freezing changed remarkably, namely salt frozen process has greater influence on pore within this range. Objectively the pore within this range in concrete suffered supercooled water osmotic pressure is the greatest. In addition, the total porosity reduced after salt freezing injury while fractal dimension changed more obviously. The fractal dimension of concrete pore could be a good reflection of concrete structure after salt freezing injury, showing that the diameter at 50nm \u223c 550nm after salt frozen injury coarsening is obvious. Thus the fractal dimension of diameter within this range can be used as a key parameters after salt freezing injury. \u00a9 (2011) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.", "pid": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1517c150"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Ming Tang", "org": "School of Materials Science and Engineering", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15006404"}, {"name": "Xiaobo Mu", "org": "School of Materials Science and Engineering", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e150319b1"}, {"name": "Yong Tian", "org": "School of Materials Science and Engineering", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f4e2fb"}], "title": "Study on the technology of exposed-aggregate roller compacted concrete pavement used in tunnels", "keywords": ["Exposed-aggregate technology", "High strength", "Road engineering", "Roller compacted concrete"], "venue": "Advanced Materials Research", "year": 2011, "abstract": "According to preparation of noise-reducing concrete with the technology of exposed-aggregate, this paper exploits high performance roller compacted concrete used in tunnels.

It implies the following three separate aspects or any of their combinations, i.e. increasing the dihedral between blade surface and endwall as much as possible, increasing the minimum curvature radius of curved transition surface that connects the blade with the endwall, and decreasing the streamwise gradient of the dihedral as the dihedral reduces streamwise. To the knowledge of the authors this is the first approach reported in the open literature that try to control corner separations and horse-shoe vortex(HSV) systematically under the guidance of the Rules of Dihedral (RD). In this paper, BBEW is applied to NASA rotor 67 which is featured by hub corner separation at the suction side and intensive HSV originating from blade leading edge at the hub. Two successive BBEW modifications are made to promote the performance of rotor 67. First, only a curved transition surface is designed to cover the hub corner at the suction side. Emphasis is paid on the streamwise distribution of the minimum curvature radius. Then, the second curved transition surface is added at the leading edge in near hub part. The nearby streamwise gradient of the dihedral is changed from infinity to a finite. Numerical tests showed that the implementation of BBEW had not only nearly eliminated the hub corner separation, but also weakened the leading edge HSV. Performance improvements are observed throughout its operation range. The work presented makes a contribution to a fully 3-D blading methodology for higher aerodynamic loading, engine efficiency and specific thrust.

Further improvement to reduce design cycle is probably a necessary concern in turbomachinery community. Due to less computational cost, adjoint method has received considerable attention in recent years. This paper focuses on continuous adjoint method, and couples with thin shear-layer N-S equations to formulate an efficient sensitivity analysis model for multi-stage turbomachinery blades in the specified objective function. This model includes adjoint equations/ boundary conditions, and the sensitivity of objective function to design variable vector. Integrating a 3D blade perturbation parameterization and the simple steepest decent method, a frame of a gradient-based aerodynamic shape design system is constructed. Numerical implementation to solve flow equations and adjoint equations is very similar, and once they are converged respectively, the sensitivity can be calculated by complex method and mesh perturbation efficiently. Thus, a fast Automatic-CFD-Design tool is developed, including three subsolvers to solve flow equations, adjoint equations and calculate sensitivity respectively.

METHODS: Sixty-eight colorectal cancer samples and matched tumor-adjacent normal tissue samples were collected to detect the expression of Bmi-1 and Mel-18 using immunohistochemistry. The relationship between the abnormal expression of Bmi-1 and Mel-18 and the clinicopathological features of colorectal carcinoma was analyzed. RESULTS: The positive rate of Bmi-1 expression was significantly higher in colorectal carcinoma than in normal colon tissue (P < 0.05), and expression of Bmi-1 was correlated with the depth of bowel wall invasion, lymph node metastasis and Dukes stage (all P < 0.05). The positive rate of Mel-18 expression was significantly lower in colorectal carcinoma than in normal colon tissue (P < 0.05), and expression of Mel-18 was negatively related to lymph node metastasis and Dukes stage (both P < 0.05). There was a negative correlation between the expression of Bmi-1 and Mel-18 in colorectal carcinoma (r = -0.335, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The expression of Bmi-1 and Mel-18 proteins correlates with the progression, metastasis and prognosis of colorectal cancer. Combined detection of Bmi-1 and Mel-18 protein expression may be helpful to the diagnosis and evaluation of the malignancy of colorectal carcinoma. \u00a9 2013 Baishideng.

Outside their natural environment, the growth of follicles might be affected by unknown factors in vitro and the elimination of regulation in vivo. Currently, in vitro culture and transplantation of ovaries under the kidney capsule are two commonly used incubation methods. However, the limited number of studies that have been published compare various incubation systems and reveal differences between ovaries that are incubated and grown in vivo. We compare the number of primordial, primary and secondary follicles in cultured, transplanted and in-vivo-grown ovaries. We investigate the expression levels of four genes, including zona pellucida 3 (ZP3), growth and differentiation factor-9 (GDF-9), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH). Our results suggest that in vitro culture accelerates follicle activation, delays the transition from primary to secondary follicles and affects the expression patterns of ZP3, GDF-9, PCNA and AMH. A larger number of secondary follicles in ovaries cultured in alpha-minimal essential medium (\u03b1-MEM) had intact zona pellucida compared with those grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium containing Ham's F-12 nutrient mixture (D/F12), suggesting that \u03b1-MEM is a better basal medium. The transplanted ovaries demonstrated the most similar characteristics to the in-vivo-grown ovaries, indicating that transplantation provided an optimal environment for ovarian incubation. This study has thus established the similarities and differences between in-vivo-grown and incubated ovaries, demonstrated that transplantation can mostly mimic the environment of ovarian growth in vivo and determined the optimal basal culture medium between \u03b1-MEM and D/F12. \u00a9 2013 The Author(s).", "pid": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e15200a9e"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Shuhong Yang", "org": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151d9afd"}, {"name": "Shuo Wang", "org": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151ea679"}, {"name": "Aiyue Luo", "org": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15111711"}, {"name": "Ting Ding", "org": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150f2746"}, {"name": "Zhiwen Lai", "org": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15034d97"}, {"name": "Wei Shen", "org": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15faace3"}, {"name": "Xiangyi Ma", "org": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1509b0e5"}, {"name": "Chen Cao", "org": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e151000e6"}, {"name": "Liangyan Shi", "org": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15005eec"}, {"name": "Jingjing Jiang", "org": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1512be25"}, {"name": "Fangfang Rong", "org": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150f61d3"}, {"name": "Lanfang Ma", "org": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f698be"}, {"name": "Yong Tian", "org": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f6c36f"}, {"name": "Xiaofang Du", "org": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151d8251"}, {"name": "Yunping Lu", "org": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e15152c6c"}, {"name": "Ya Li", "org": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15130c99"}, {"name": "Shixuan Wang", "org": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1504eba9"}], "title": "Expression patterns and regulatory functions of microRNAs during the initiation of primordial follicle development in the neonatal mouse ovary", "keywords": ["miR-145", "p-Smad3", "Primordial follicle initiation", "TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway"], "venue": "Biology of Reproduction", "year": 2013, "abstract": "The initiation of primordial follicle development is essential for female fertility, but the signals that trigger this process are poorly understood. Given the potentially important roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the ovary, we aimed to study the expression patterns and regulatory functions of miRNAs during the initiation of primordial follicle development. Expression patterns of miRNA in the neonatal mouse ovary were profiled by microarray, and 24 miRNAs whose abundances differed significantly between ovaries from 3-and 5-day-old mice were identified. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that 48 signal transduction pathways are modulated by the up-regulated miRNAs and 29 pathways are modulated by the down-regulated miRNAs (P-value and false discovery rate < 0.001). A miRNAmRNA regulatory network was established for TGF-beta signaling pathway-related genes. Among the miRNAs involved in this pathway, miR-145 was chosen for further analysis. Downregulation of miR-145 using an antagomir (AT) decreased the proportion and number of the primordial follicles and increased that of the growing follicles in the cultured ovaries (P < 0.05). The mean oocyte diameter in the primordial follicles was significantly greater in the AT group relative to the AT-negative control group (P < 0.05), whereas the mean oocyte diameter in growing follicles was smaller in the AT group than in the AT-negative control group. In addition, we confirmed that miR-145 targets Tgfbr2. The miR-145 AT caused an increase in TGFBR2 expression and activation of Smad signaling but did not affect the p38 MAPK or JNK pathway. These data suggest that miRNAs and the signaling pathways they modulate are involved in the initiation of primordial follicle development, and miR-145 targets Tgfbr2 to regulate the initiation of primordial follicle development and maintain primordial follicle quiescence. \u00a9 2013 by the Society for the Study of Reproduction, Inc.", "pid": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150f5d6e"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Fudong Ma", "org": "Key Laboratory of Functional Polymers", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1512a0ff"}, {"name": "Wei Shi", "org": "Key Laboratory of Functional Polymers", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e1510064a"}, {"name": "Hongyu Mi", "org": "Key Laboratory of Petroleum and Gas Fine Chemicals", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1505d89c"}, {"name": "Jianmin Luo", "org": "Key Laboratory of Petroleum and Gas Fine Chemicals", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151d34b0"}, {"name": "Yanli Lei", "org": "Key Laboratory of Functional Polymers", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fe4628"}, {"name": "Yong Tian", "org": "Key Laboratory of Functional Polymers", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f52e99"}], "title": "Triphenylamine-based conjugated polymer/I- complex as turn-on optical probe for mercury(II) ion", "keywords": ["'Turn-off'", "'Turn-on'", "Conjugated polymer", "Optical probe", "Triphenylamine"], "venue": "Sensors and Actuators, B: Chemical", "year": 2013, "abstract": "A kind of triphenylamine-based conjugated polymer with simple structure, poly(9,9-dioctyl)-2,7-fluorene-co-N-4-phenylethenyl-4,4\u2032-triphenylamine (PFT-PE), was successfully synthesized via Suzuki coupling reaction.

Process-based, spatially distributed, and dynamic models provide desirable resolutions to the management of NPS pollution. However, their reliability in solving real management problems has been seriously questioned, since the model simulation usually involves significant uncertainty with complicated origins. This chapter addresses origins, complexity, and quantification approaches of the uncertainty, as well as its impact on management decisions. A framework for addressing the uncertainty in modeling watershed NPS pollution was first presented. Within this framework, different sources of the uncertainty were discussed and strategies to quantify the uncertainty sources were reviewed. Recent advances in uncertainty analysis (UA) techniques for complex watershed water quality models were then introduced. It has been recognized that UA alone does not guarantee the reduction of uncertainty, and improving data and model structure would be the ultimate solution. The next generation of watershed NPS pollution models must incorporate recent and future advances in understanding the pollution process, and reduce the model structure uncertainty by better representing the process in the models. Future research directions for addressing the uncertainty issue were discussed as well. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier B.V.", "pid": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e151778e8"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Bin Wu", "org": "Center for Water Research, College of Engineering, Peking University", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e151fb038"}, {"name": "Yi Zheng", "org": "Center for Water Research, College of Engineering, Peking University", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15012c00"}, {"name": "Yong Tian", "org": "Center for Water Research, College of Engineering, Peking University", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e15082611"}, {"name": "Xin Wu", "org": "Center for Water Research, College of Engineering, Peking University", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e151fc8eb"}, {"name": "Yingying Yao", "org": "Center for Water Research, College of Engineering, Peking University", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151a6d88"}, {"name": "Feng Han", "org": "Center for Water Research, College of Engineering, Peking University", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f7c98f"}, {"name": "Jie Liu", "org": "Center for Water Research, College of Engineering, Peking University", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f5095c"}, {"name": "Chunmiao Zheng", "org": "Center for Water Research, College of Engineering, Peking University", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15129829"}], "title": "Systematic assessment of the uncertainty in integrated surface water-groundwater modeling based on the probabilistic collocation method", "keywords": ["GSFLOW", "Heihe River Basin", "integrated modeling", "probabilistic collocation method", "surface water-groundwater interaction", "uncertainty analysis"], "venue": "Water Resources Research", "year": 2014, "abstract": "Systematic uncertainty analysis (UA) has rarely been conducted for integrated modeling of surface water-groundwater (SW-GW) systems, which is subject to significant uncertainty, especially at a large basin scale. The main objective of this study was to explore an innovative framework in which a systematic UA can be effectively and efficiently performed for integrated SW-GW models of large river basins and to illuminate how process understanding, model calibration, data collection, and management can benefit from such a systematic UA. The framework is based on the computationally efficient Probabilistic Collocation Method (PCM) linked with a complex simulation model. The applicability and advantages of the framework were evaluated and validated through an integrated SW-GW model for the Zhangye Basin in the middle Heihe River Basin, northwest China. The framework for systematic UA allows for a holistic assessment of the modeling uncertainty, yielding valuable insights into the hydrological processes, model structure, data deficit, and potential effectiveness of management. The study shows that, under the complex SW-GW interactions, the modeling uncertainty has great spatial and temporal variabilities and is highly output-dependent. Overall, this study confirms that a systematic UA should play a critical role in integrated SW-GW modeling of large river basins, and the PCM-based approach is a promising option to fulfill this role.

Its applicability and advantages were evaluated and validated through an optimization research on the conjunctive use of surface water (SW) and groundwater (GW) for irrigation in a semiarid region in northwest China. GSFLOW, an integrated SW-GW model developed by USGS, was employed. The study results show that, due to the strong and complicated SW-GW interactions, basin-scale water saving could be achieved by spatially optimizing the ratios of groundwater use in different irrigation districts. The water-saving potential essentially stems from the reduction of nonbeneficial evapotranspiration from the aqueduct system and shallow groundwater, and its magnitude largely depends on both water management schemes and hydrological conditions. Important implications for water resources management in general include: first, environmental flow regulation needs to take into account interannual variation of hydrological conditions, as well as spatial complexity of SW-GW interactions; and second, to resolve water use conflicts between upper stream and lower stream, a system approach is highly desired to reflect ecological, economic, and social concerns in water management decisions.

In this study, a visualization tool named IHM3D was designed and developed specifically for integrated SW-GW modeling. In IHM3D, spatially distributed model inputs/outputs and geo-referenced data sets are visualized in a virtual globe-based 3D environment. End users can conveniently explore and validate modeling results within the 3D environment. A GSLFOW (an integrated SW-GW model developed by USGS) modeling case in the Heihe River Basin (Northwest China) was used to demonstrate the applicability of IHM3D at a large basin scale. The visualization of the modeling results significantly improved the understanding of the complex hydrologic cycle in this water-limited area, and provided insights into the regional water resources management. This study shows that visualization tools like IHM3D can promote data and model sharing in the water resources research community, and make it more practical to perform complex hydrological modeling in real-world water resources management.", "pid": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e150009a1"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Xin Wu", "org": "College of Engineering", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e151fc8eb"}, {"name": "Yi Zheng", "org": "College of Engineering", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15012c00"}, {"name": "Bin Wu", "org": "College of Engineering", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151c519e"}, {"name": "Yong Tian", "org": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e15082611"}, {"name": "Feng Han", "org": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150af861"}, {"name": "Chunmiao Zheng", "org": "Department of Geological Sciences", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150a6818"}], "title": "Optimizing conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater for irrigation to address human-nature water conflicts: A surrogate modeling approach", "keywords": ["Heihe River Basin", "Integrated surface water-groundwater modeling", "Irrigation", "Optimization", "Surrogate modeling", "Water diversion"], "venue": "Agricultural Water Management", "year": 2015, "abstract": "In arid and semi-arid areas where agriculture competes keenly with ecosystem for water, integrated management of both surface water (SW) and groundwater (GW) resources at a basin scale is crucial, but often lacks scientific support. This study implemented physically-based, fully integrated SW-GW modeling in optimizing water management, and performed surrogate modeling to replace the computationally expensive model with simple response surfaces. Water use conflicts between agriculture and ecosystem in Heihe River Basin (HRB), the second largest inland river basin in China, were investigated. Based on the integrated model GSFLOW (Coupled Ground-Water and Surface-Water Flow Model), the conjunctive use of SW and GW for irrigation in the study area was optimized using a surrogate-based approach named DYCORS (DYnamic COordinate search using Response Surface models). Overall, the study demonstrated that, with the surrogate modeling approach, an expensive integrated model could be efficiently incorporated into an optimization analysis, and the integrated modeling would make feasible a physically based interpretation of the optimization results. In the HRB case study, the surrogate-based optimization suggested a very different time schedule of water diversion in opposite to the existing one, indicating the critical role of SW-GW interactions in the water cycle. With the temporal optimization, a basin-scale water saving could be achieved by reducing non-beneficial evapotranspiration. In addition, the current flow regulation in HRB may not be sustainable, because the ecosystem recovery in the lower HRB would be at the cost of the ecosystem degradation in the middle HRB.", "pid": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f8fc28"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Ying Guo", "org": "SINOPEC Beijing Research Institute of Chemical Industry", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151ebe44"}, {"name": "Xiaohong Yang", "org": "SINOPEC Beijing Research Institute of Chemical Industry", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150f275c"}, {"name": "Yong Tian", "org": "SINOPEC Beijing Research Institute of Chemical Industry", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151e9d5e"}, {"name": "Yonggang Zhang", "org": "SINOPEC Beijing Research Institute of Chemical Industry", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e1500fef5"}, {"name": "Zhiguo Du", "org": "SINOPEC Beijing Research Institute of Chemical Industry", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151ba644"}, {"name": "Guoqing Wang", "org": "SINOPEC Beijing Research Institute of Chemical Industry", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150c4263"}], "title": "Pretreatment of cracking feedstock by aromatic extraction", "keywords": ["Aromatic extraction", "Cracking feedstock", "Ethylene", "Naphtha", "Steam cracking"], "venue": "Shiyou Huagong/Petrochemical Technology", "year": 2014, "abstract": "Liquid-liquid extraction of poor naphtha containing high content aromatics (10%- 30% (w)) with sulfolane as the extractant and the steam cracking of the extracted naphtha were carried out to solve the shortage of raw materials for the cracking.

Material and Methods: In this prospective, controlled study, all patients with aSAH classified as WFNS grade III who underwent coil placement at our institution were divided randomly into 2 groups: the EVD group and the LD group. The ratios of intracerebral hemorrhage, vasospasm, infection, duration of catheter placement, hydrocephalus, and Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) after 2 months of onset were analyzed between the 2 groups. Results: A total of 148 patients (mean age 56.8 years) were enrolled in this study. Seventy-six patients were assigned to the EVD group, and 72 patients were assigned to the LD group. The average time interval from stroke onset to surgery was 35.1 h. Compared with the EVD group, the LD group had a lower incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage, slightly higher rates of infection and hydrocephalus, and similar vasospasm and chronic hydrocephalus rates, durations of catheter placement, and GOS scores at 2 months after onset.

Topiramate (TPM) is a novel, broad-spectrum, antiepileptic drug with a reported protective effect against several brain injuries. The current study aimed to investigate the potential of TPM for neuroprotection against EBI after SAH and the possible dose-dependency of this effect. An endovascular perforation SAH model was established in rats, and TPM was administered by intraperitoneal injection after surgery at three different doses (20 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg, and 80 mg/kg). The animals' neurological scores and brain water content were evaluated, and ELISA, Western blotting and immunostaining assays were conducted to assess the effect of TPM. The results revealed that TPM lowers the elevated levels of myeloperoxidase and proinflammatory mediators observed after SAH in a dose-related fashion, and the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) signalling pathway is the target of neuroinflammation regulation. In addition, TPM ameliorated SAH-induced cortical neuronal apoptosis by influencing Bax, Bcl-2 and cleaved caspase-3 protein expression, and the effect of TPM was enhanced in a dose-dependent manner. Various dosages of TPM also upregulated the protein expression of the \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic signalling molecules, GABA<inf>A</inf> receptor (GABA<inf>A</inf>R) \u03b11, GABA<inf>A</inf>R \u03b32, and K<sup>+</sup>-Cl<sup>-</sup> co-transporter 2 (KCC2) together and downregulated Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-Cl<sup>-</sup> co-transporter 1 (NKCC1) expression.

Liver cancer stem cells (CSCs) may well contribute to both of these pathological properties, but the mechanisms underlying their self-renewal and maintenance are poorly understood. Here, using transcriptome microarray analysis, we identified a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) termed lncTCF7 that is highly expressed in HCC tumors and liver CSCs. LncTCF7 is required for liver CSC self-renewal and tumor propagation. Mechanistically, lncTCF7 recruits the SWI/SNF complex to the promoter of TCF7 to regulate its expression, leading to activation of Wnt signaling. Our data suggest that lncTCF7-mediated Wnt signaling primes liver CSC self-renewal and tumor propagation. In sum, therefore, we have identified an lncRNA-based Wnt signaling regulatory circuit that promotes tumorigenic activity in liver cancer stem cells, highlighting the role that lncRNAs can play in tumor growth and propagation.", "pid": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e15208d27"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Yong Tian", "org": "Steelmaking Plant of Angang Steel Co.

In this paper, a mathematical model of PV array under partial shading conditions with a voltage calculated principle is established. The presented model is implemented with an m-file in MATLAB software, which is used as a tool to study the non-linear characteristics of current-voltage (I-V) and P-V curves of PV array, as well as quickly develop the GMPP tracking controllers. Besides, an adaptive random particle swarm optimization (ARPSO) algorithm is presented to accurately extract the GMPP under partial shading conditions. Five simulation cases with different partial shading patterns are used to evaluate the performance of the presented approach by comparing with the conventional PSO, perturbation and observation (P&O), incremental conductance (INC), and genetic algorithm (GA) methods. Simulation results show that the ARPSO algorithm can rapidly find the GMPP under different shading conditions compared with the conventional PSO algorithm. Furthermore, the presented algorithm can accurately extract the GMPP when the shading condition sharply changes, while the P&O and INC algorithms fail to track the GMPP, but only detect the rightmost MPP encountered either local or global and regardless of the course.

However, it is difficult to get an accurate value of SOC since it is an inner sate of a battery cell, which cannot be directly measured. This paper presents an Adaptive Cubature Kalman filter (ACKF)-based SOC estimation algorithm for lithium-ion batteries in electric vehicles. Firstly, the lithium-ion battery is modeled using the second-order resistor-capacitor (RC) equivalent circuit and parameters of the battery model are determined by the forgetting factor least-squares method. Then, the Adaptive Cubature Kalman filter for battery SOC estimation is introduced and the estimated process is presented. Finally, two typical driving cycles, including the Dynamic Stress Test (DST) and New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) are applied to evaluate the performance of the proposed method by comparing with the traditional extended Kalman filter (EKF) and cubature Kalman filter (CKF) algorithms. Experimental results show that the ACKF algorithm has better performance in terms of SOC estimation accuracy, convergence to different initial SOC errors and robustness against voltage measurement noise as compared with the traditional EKF and CKF algorithms.", "pid": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f6eb93"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Bin Dai", "org": "Institute of Chemical Materials, Chinese Academy of Engineering Physics", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f6522a"}, {"name": "Wei-Bin Zhang", "org": "Institute of Chemical Materials, Chinese Academy of Engineering Physics", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1505a7e3"}, {"name": "Lin-Gang Lan", "org": "Institute of Chemical Materials, Chinese Academy of Engineering Physics", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e15183127"}, {"name": "Yong Tian", "org": "Institute of Chemical Materials, Chinese Academy of Engineering Physics", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151dcf35"}], "title": "Experimental Study and DEM Simulation of Micro-Macro Behavior of TATB Granules during Compaction Using X-ray Tomography", "keywords": ["Compacting process", "Discrete element method (DEM)", "Materials testing and analysis", "TATB granules", "X-ray tomography"], "venue": "Propellants, Explosives, Pyrotechnics", "year": 2015, "abstract": "In this study, a noninvasive experimental method and a discrete element method (DEM) model were used to investigate the micro-macro behavior of TATB granules including global deformations, contact forces, stress distributions, local coordination number, local pore ratio, particle kinematics, and granule displacement during compacting process.

Here, we sought to develop such a protocol using mechanical dissection combined with brief collagenase-DNase digestion. Morphological characteristics and molecular markers were detected to identify TICs and GCs. In isolated TICs, cholesterol side chain cleavage cytochrome P450 (P450scc) was expressed abundantly, but anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) was expressed only at very low levels. This expression profile was reversed in GCs. In addition, TICs secreted large amounts of testosterone (T) and minimal amounts of estradiol (E<inf>2</inf>), while the converse was found in GCs. T concentrations rose gradually in TIC culture media as the concentration of added luteinizing hormone (LH) was increased. In GCs, E<inf>2</inf> secretion increased as the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentration increased. Thus, mechanical dissection combined with collagenase-DNase digestion is a simple, effective and reproducible method for obtaining large numbers of highly purified and hormonally stimulated TICs and GCs from one ovary.", "pid": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fd774f"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Xiaoming Wang", "org": "School of Computer and Software Engineering, Xihua University", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151f6074"}, {"name": "Yong Tian", "org": "School of Computer and Software Engineering, Xihua University", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151e5d3f"}, {"name": "Xiaohuan Yang", "org": "School of Computer and Software Engineering, Xihua University", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150bd90d"}, {"name": "Yajun Du", "org": "School of Computer and Software Engineering, Xihua University", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e15071a1d"}], "title": "Locality preserving one-class support vector machine", "keywords": ["Data description", "Kernel methods", "One-class SVM", "Unsupervised learning"], "venue": "Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)", "year": 2015, "abstract": "One-class support vector machine (OCSVM) tries to find a hyperplane to distinguish normal data from all other possible outliers or abnormal data.

Key Points: Crosschecking hydrological modeling results with remote sensing-derived data sets Scale-dependence of ET and LAI characterized via integrated modeling Integrated modeling results shed light on solving transboundary water conflicts", "pid": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f775be"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Zhan Shi", "org": "Dalian University of Technology", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1504da91"}, {"name": "Zhenan Tang", "org": "Dalian University of Technology", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150a42e1"}, {"name": "Yong Tian", "org": "Dalian University of Technology", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15022332"}, {"name": "Hung Pham", "org": "CNRS, UMR7178", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1507db58"}, {"name": "Isabelle Valin", "org": "CNRS, UMR7178", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fc8e10"}, {"name": "Kimmo Jaaskelainen", "org": "CNRS, UMR7178", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1509ed00"}], "title": "A high speed, low power consumption LVDS interface for CMOS pixel sensors", "keywords": ["CPS", "Data transmission", "Low power", "LVDS", "Particle tracking"], "venue": "Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research, Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment", "year": 2015, "abstract": "The use of CMOS Pixel Sensors (CPSs) offers a promising approach to the design of vertex detectors in High Energy Physics (HEP) experiments. As the CPS equipping the upgraded Solenoidal Tracker at RHIC (STAR) pixel detector, ULTIMATE perfectly illustrates the potential of CPSs for HEP applications. However, further development of CPSs with respect to readout speed is required to fulfill the readout time requirement of the next generation HEP detectors, such as the upgrade of A Large Ion Collider Experiment (ALICE) Inner Tracking System (ITS), the International Linear Collider (ILC), and the Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) vertex detectors. One actual limitation of CPSs is related to the speed of the Low-Voltage Differential Signaling (LVDS) circuitry implementing the interface between the sensor and the Data Acquisition (DAQ) system. To improve the transmission rate while keeping the power consumption at a low level, a source termination technique and a special current comparator were adopted for the LVDS driver and receiver, respectively. Moreover, hardening techniques are used. The circuitry was designed and submitted for fabrication in a 0.18-\u03bcm CMOS Image Sensor (CIS) process at the end of 2011. The test results indicated that the LVDS driver and receiver can operate properly at the data rate of 1.2 Gb/s with power consumption of 19.6 mW.", "pid": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15002b5f"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Chun-Yan Chen", "org": "Department of Geriatrics, People's Hospital of Zhengzhou", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15025b4e"}, {"name": "Shao-Li Zhang", "org": "Department of Cardiology, First Affiliated Hospital, Xinxiang Medical University", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fb8024"}, {"name": "Zhi-Yong Liu", "org": "Department of Internal Medicine, People's Hospital of Dezhou", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1507b37f"}, {"name": "Yong Tian", "org": "Department of Geriatrics, People's Hospital of Zhengzhou", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150e8000"}, {"name": "Qian Sun", "org": "Department of Geriatrics, People's Hospital of Zhengzhou", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151ddef2"}], "title": "Cadmium toxicity induces ER stress and apoptosis via impairing energy homoeostasis in cardiomyocytes", "keywords": ["AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)", "Cadmium toxicity", "Cardiomyocytes", "Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress", "Energy metabolism"], "venue": "Bioscience Reports", "year": 2015, "abstract": "Cadmium, a highly toxic environmental pollutant, is reported to induce toxicity and apoptosis in multiple organs and cells, all possibly contributing to apoptosis in certain pathophysiologic situations.

Although many progresses have been made, the mechanism responsible for cadmium-induced cellular alternations and cardiac toxicity is still not fully understood. In the present study, we demonstrated that cadmium toxicity induced dramatic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and impaired energy homoeostasis in cultured cardiomyocytes.

Resurgent androgen receptor activity is an established driver of castration-resistant progression, and upregulation of androgen receptor expression has been implicated to contribute to the resurgent androgen receptor activity. We reported previously that methylselenocysteine can decrease the expression and activity of androgen receptor. Here we investigated the ability of methylselenocysteine to inhibit castration-resistant progression of prostate cancer. METHODS The regrowth of LNCaP prostate cancer xenografts after castration was monitored. The levels of prostate-specific antigen in mouse serum were measured by ELISA. Tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis were analyzed via Ki-67 immunohistochemistry and TUNEL assay, respectively. Intratumoral angiogenesis was assessed by immunohistochemistry staining of vascular endothelial growth factor and CD31. RESULTS We showed that methylselenocysteine delayed castration-resistant regrowth of LNCaP xenograft tumors after androgen deprivation. This was accompanied by decreased serum levels of prostate-specific antigen, inhibition of prostate cancer cell proliferation and tumor angiogenesis, as well as downregulation of androgen receptor and induction of apoptosis in the relapsed tumors. CONCLUSIONS The present study represents the first to show the preclinical efficacy of methylselenocysteine in delaying castration-resistant progression of prostate cancer. The findings provide a rationale for evaluating the clinical application of combining methylselenocysteine with androgen deprivation therapy for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.
