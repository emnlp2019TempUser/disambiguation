The results show that the diffusion of solute atoms in GH4199 alloy can be strongly accelerated by electropulsing. The growth activation energy of \u03b3' phase of 89.86 kJ/mol in the alloy electropulsing-treated, decreases by 64.31% compared with that normally aged, which accelerates the precipitation and the growth of both the \u03b3' phase and carbides on the grain boundary of the alloy. The strength of GH4199 alloy increases with increasing of electropulsing treatment time, and the plasticity has no obvious change. The growth of \u03b3' phase and the precipitation of carbides on the grain boundary is the main reason for obstructing the dislocation motion and improving the plastic deformation resistance of the alloy. The piled-up dislocations can go through the grain boundary across the gap of carbides which is distributed on the grain boundary in chainlike form, and no degradation of the plasticity of GH4199 alloy appears.

The assay relies on the electrostatic adsorption of target oligonucleotides onto the sensing surface of the glassy carbon electrode (GCE) and its hybridization to the gold nanoparticle-labeled oligonucleotides DNA probe. After silver deposition onto gold nanoparticles, binding events between probe and target were monitored by the differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) signal of the large number of silver atoms anchored on the hybrids at the electrode surface. The signal intensity difference permits to distinguish between the match of two perfectly matched DNA strands and the near-perfect match where just one base pair was wrong. Coupled with this 'nanoparticle-promoted' reduction of silver signal amplification method, the sensitivity of this electrochemical DNA biosensor has been increased by approximately two orders of magnitude and a detection limit of 50pM of complementary oligonucleotides was obtained. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The better result is achieved by applying the two new algorithms to a given database for e-shoppers. \u00a9 2010 IEEE.", "pid": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151cac36"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Gaopan Huang", "org": "Integrated Information System Research Center", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150b0abb"}, {"name": "Yuan Tian", "org": "Integrated Information System Research Center", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151beb2c"}, {"name": "Yanqing Wang", "org": "Integrated Information System Research Center", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1508526c"}, {"name": "Yiping Yang", "org": "Integrated Information System Research Center", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150fc893"}, {"name": "Xianqing Tai", "org": "Integrated Information System Research Center", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151c0f04"}], "title": "Self-recalibration of PTZ cameras", "keywords": ["Displacement constraint", "Point matching", "PTZ camera", "Self-recalibration"], "venue": "2010 International Conference on Machine Vision and Human-Machine Interface, MVHI 2010", "year": 2010, "abstract": "Pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) cameras have been widely used for providing flexible view selection and a wider observation range. In order to utilize these cameras for a meaning application, it is necessary to calibrate cameras. However, with camera pan, tilt and zoom, the previous calibrated camera parameters often vary, which are required to be updated automatically. In this paper, we present a novel self-recalibtion method of PTZ cameras under a small pitch angle. The proposed approach is based on the calibrated camera. First, the keypoints from two frames, corresponding to ones before and after the parameters are changed, are matched roughly, then the false matching pairs are removed by the displacement constraint, which is statistical displacement constraint in pan and tilt, while in zoom is principal point constraint. Second, the homography between the two frames can be estimated from the matching ones, then the camera parameters can be updated by combining previous known parameters. Furthermore, we present a evaluation method of recalibration precision. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. \u00a9 2010 IEEE.", "pid": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15005f51"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Chong Wang", "org": "Business School", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1504d99f"}, {"name": "Jian Liu", "org": "Library", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f9e08e"}, {"name": "Yanqing Wang", "org": "School of Management", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1508526c"}], "title": "Mining E-shoppers' purchase rules based on K-trees sequential pattern", "keywords": ["E-shopper", "Rule", "Sequential pattern", "Tree"], "venue": "Proceedings - 2010 7th International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery, FSKD 2010", "year": 2010, "abstract": "With the rapid development of online shopping, electronic commerce has offered a new channel for instant on-line shopping.

Finally, roads are detected with a sliding window by using the learning results and validated by combining the road connectivity.

Na is the critical element which enlarges the difference in expansion coefficients between the glaze and body of imitated GE ware.

Cell therapy to release antinociceptive agents near the pain processing centers of the spinal cord is a promising next step in the development of treatment modalities. This study investigated the effects of the combination of EA and cell therapy by glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) on neuropathic pain in rats. The hyperalgesic state was induced by chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve and fibroblasts genetically modified to secrete bioactive GDNF (FBs-GDNF) were used for cell therapy. Fifty-eight rats with neuropathic pain were randomly divided into five groups (CCI+PBS, n = 11; CCI+FBs-GDNF, n = 12; CCI+EA+PBS, n = 11; CCI+EA+FBs-pLNCX2, n = 12; CCI+EA+FBs-GDNF, n = 12). On the 7th day after CCI, the rats received intrathecal transplantation of FBs-GDNF or control fibroblasts (FBs-pLNCX2). In the meantime, EA was administered once every other day from the 7th day after CCI surgery for 21 days. The paw withdrawal latency (PWL) to radiant heat was measured every other day. The results showed that the ipsilateral PWL of the rats from all three EA treatment groups significantly increased starting on the 12th day compared with the PBS control group. Strikingly, the group which received EA treatment and FBs-GDNF transplantation (CCI+EA+FBs-GDNF) showed a significantly decreased thermal hyperalgesia after 2 weeks post CCI surgery compared with the groups which received EA treatment and FBs-pLNCX2 transplantation (CCI+EA+FBs-pLNCX2) or PBS (CCI+EA+PBS) as well as the FBs-GDNF transplantation group without EA treatment (CCI+FBs-GDNF). Our data suggest that EA and cell therapy can synergistically attenuate hyperalgesia in neuropathic pain rats. \u00a9 2013 World Scientific Publishing Company & Institute for Advanced Research in Asian Science and Medicine.", "pid": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15032c4d"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Gencheng Wu", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Medical Neurobiology", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150cfba7"}, {"name": "Yanqing Wang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Medical Neurobiology", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151c3da0"}, {"name": "Xiaoding Cao", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Medical Neurobiology", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150c4eec"}], "title": "Acupuncture-drug balanced anesthesia", "keywords": ["Acupuncture", "Analgesia", "Anesthesia", "Balanced"], "venue": "Acupuncture Therapy for Neurological Diseases: A Neurobiological View", "year": 2010, "abstract": "In this chapter, the clinical and experimental studies on acupuncture-drug balanced anesthesia will be reviewed. The history of acupuncture anesthesia in China started in 1958. After two decades of clinical practice and experimental investigation, the combination of acupuncture (usually electro-acupuncture, EA) with drugs has been successfully used to improve anesthesia for surgical operations and pain treatment since the 1980s, and this technique is now known as the acupuncture-drug balanced anesthesia in China. It is more advantageous to use acupuncture combined with selected drugs to produce anesthesia, because acupuncture could regulate the functions of multiple organs of the body in addition to analgesia. Moreover, the underlying mechanism has been elucidated by investigating the potentiation effects of some commonly used drugs on acupuncture analgesia, in various animal models. Substantial evidence has shown that the combination of acupuncture with these drugs promotes the release of endogenous opioid peptides (EOP). In addition, these drugs potentiate EA-induced expression of EOP gene. Furthermore, several lines of evidence show that EA induces an increase in both binding affinity and density of the opioid receptors, while the combined use of acupuncture with drugs can further enhance the EA effect. Currently, clinical and bench studies on acupuncture-drug balanced anesthesia are still in progress to improve the clinical efficacy and to better understand the working mechanisms. We expect that new discoveries through the translational research will bring more benefits to patients. \u00a9 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.", "pid": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15129f7b"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Yanqing Wang", "org": "Department of Integrative Medicine and Neurobiology", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151c3da0"}, {"name": "Gencheng Wu", "org": "Department of Integrative Medicine and Neurobiology", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150cfba7"}], "title": "Neurochemical basis of electroacupuncture analgesia on acute and chronic pain", "keywords": ["Acute pain", "Chronic pain", "Endogenous opioid peptides", "Inflammatory cytokines", "Neurotransmitters"], "venue": "Acupuncture Therapy for Neurological Diseases: A Neurobiological View", "year": 2010, "abstract": "Electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation has immediate or cumulative (therapeutic) effects on acute pain and chronic pain in various experimental models.

Due to membrane retention, the biomass concentration is able to reach 5 g/L within two months of continuous operation. Pannonibacter sp. W1 is able to adapt to the high loading rate of 1000 mg 4-ABS/L and achieve a remarkable 4-ABS removal efficiency of 99% within 6 h. Strain W1 grows well under the MBR continuous operation and remains as the dominant bacterium at the end of 60 days continuous operation. Minor membrane fouling has been detected within 40 days of operating at 15 LMH. At a flux of 25 LMH, the system experiences the 'TMP jump'.

As such, we have developed a comprehensive web application tool for processing mRNA-seq and miRNA-seq data. Our web tool wapRNA includes four different modules: mRNA-seq and miRNAseq sequenced from SOLiD or Solexa platform and all the modules were tested on previously published experimental data. We accept raw sequence data with an optional reads filter, followed by mapping and gene annotation or miRNA prediction. wapRNA also integrates downstream functional analyses such as Gene Ontology, KEGG pathway, miRNA targets prediction and comparison of gene's or miRNA's different expression in different samples.

In addition, the pancreatic CD45 expression and the expression of claudin-1, but not zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin, in the intestinal tissues were significantly reduced after the induction of AP. However, oxymatrine increased the expression of claudin-1 and CD45, but did not alter the expression of ZO-1 and occludin. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that oxymatrine is potentially capably of protecting against L-arginine-induced AP and attenuating AP-associated intestinal barrier injury by up-regulation of claudin-1. \u00a9 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.", "pid": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15128b54"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Qiaoxia Guo", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Heavy Oil Processing", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150ddbb9"}, {"name": "Wennian Wang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Heavy Oil Processing", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ff3196"}, {"name": "Weiling Teng", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Heavy Oil Processing", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f92d3c"}, {"name": "Liwei Chen", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Heavy Oil Processing", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15119f0d"}, {"name": "Yanqing Wang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Heavy Oil Processing", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1509a9e4"}, {"name": "Baojian Shen", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Heavy Oil Processing", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151d7e8f"}], "title": "Oxidant effect of H 2O 2 for the syntheses of quinoline derivatives via one-pot reaction of aniline and aldehyde", "keywords": ["Aldehyde", "Aniline", "Hydrogen peroxide", "Oxidation", "Quinoline derivatives"], "venue": "Synthetic Communications", "year": 2012, "abstract": "(Chemical Equation Presented) A convenient one-pot method for the synthesis of substituted quinolines via the reaction of aniline and aldehyde in the presence of a Lewis acid (AlCl ", "pid": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e1500d6b7"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Qiaoxia Guo", "org": "China University of Petroleum - Hokkaido University Joint Laboratory", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150ddbb9"}, {"name": "Weiling Teng", "org": "China University of Petroleum - Hokkaido University Joint Laboratory", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f92d3c"}, {"name": "Shenyong Ren", "org": "China University of Petroleum - Hokkaido University Joint Laboratory", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f66b13"}, {"name": "Shasha Rao", "org": "China University of Petroleum - Hokkaido University Joint Laboratory", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151ad6c8"}, {"name": "Yanqing Wang", "org": "China University of Petroleum - Hokkaido University Joint Laboratory", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1509a9e4"}, {"name": "Liwei Chen", "org": "China University of Petroleum - Hokkaido University Joint Laboratory", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15119f0d"}, {"name": "Baojian Shen", "org": "China University of Petroleum - Hokkaido University Joint Laboratory", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151d7e8f"}, {"name": "Tamotsu Takahashi", "org": "Catalysis Research Center, Hokkaido University", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151d1025"}], "title": "Efficient synthesis of tetrahydroquinolines from the reaction of aldehyde, aniline, and alkene under the in situ redox of SnCl2 and FeCl 3 ", "keywords": ["Aldehyde", "Alkenes", "Anilines", "Hetero-Diels-Alder Reaction", "Tetrahydroquinolines Derivatives"], "venue": "Journal of Heterocyclic Chemistry", "year": 2014, "abstract": "A highly efficient three-component Povarov reaction for the synthesis of tetrahydroquinoline derivatives was reported.

Due to their lower prices, airbags for the driver and the front passenger are not standard but only an option in some high end models. This paper describes the procedures that were used in an airbag system development based on a contract with one of the microvan makers to install front airbags in the majority of microvans in production. Front impact tests demonstrated that when airbags were installed for the driver and the front passenger, head injury parameters were reduced significantly. It also shows that front impact characteristics of microvans are different from other vehicles. In particular, the peak accelerations and the rates in high speed impacts are high, and the times to reach the peaks are early as compared to SUVs and other small passenger cars. The development of the airbag system control algorithm for microvans is summarized here. Impact verification tests have shown that the algorithm based on a combined \"Time Window+Acceleration Change + Angled Impact Recognition\" method satisfied the requirements of the microvans must-not-deploy and must-deploy conditions. Additionally, the important purpose of this work is to emphasize that airbag systems should not be optional and encourage other microvan makers to install front airbag systems as the standard safety measure.

The following results were obtained. (1) The areal distributions of the Denglouku Formation sandstones in the Changling1 gas field varies greatly, with the thicker sandtone occurring mainly in areas along the Changshen 103, Changshen 1-3, Changshen 1-1 wells and the Changshen 2 well. The thickness of sandstone decreases progressively in northeast direction. The thickness of D3 layer near in the Changshen 103 well is up to 33.2 m. (2) The major D3 and D4 pay zones in the Denglouku Formation have a relatively low porosity, averaging at only about 5%. The sandbodies with relatively high porosity (>9%) only occur in area around the Changshen 1 well. The Denglouku Formation is tight as a whole. (3) Comparison of the inversion results with the actual test data shows that the error of sandstone thickness is within 2.5 m and the error of the porosity is under 0.49%, indicating a high reliability of the inversion results.

The results show that the radial adjustments have exhibited a decreasing trend, while structural, slack adjustments have practically disappeared. The course of the dynamic adjustments suggests that there has been a transformation from labor-intensive to land-intensive and capital-intensive operations which will continue to dominate China's wheat production sector.

Over-summering strategies are important for the population dynamics of C. sinicus. In this paper, we studied the lipid content as well as the abundance and structure of the C. sinicus population in the southern Yellow Sea and East China Sea in summer to enhance our understating of the various over-summering strategies. In August 2011, C. sinicus was collected using a 500 \u03bcm mesh ring net (mouth opening, 0.5 m<sup>2</sup>). The samples used for studying the abundance and structure of the population were preserved in 5% formalin seawater solutions. The total lipid content was extracted from fifth copepodite (C5) or female C. sinicus with 3 mL chloroform: methanol (2:1 v/ v) at -20\u00bafor 16 h and weighted on a Cahn electrobalance (\u00b1100 \u03bcg). The lipid content was separated using a chromatographic method and analyzed in duplicate using Iatroscan\u00ae MKS-6 with flame ionization detector (FID). The results showed that certain regions in the Yellow Sea Cold Bottom Waters (YSCBW, water temperature<10\u00baC) had the highest amount of C. sinicus ranging from 93.3 ind/ m<sup>3</sup> to 446.9 ind/ m<sup>3</sup> (mean, 242.6 ind/ m<sup>3</sup>). The area near the shore of the East China Sea also showed an abundant C. sinicus population (range, 60.8\u2014148.4 ind/ m<sup>3</sup>; mean, 91.0 ind/ m<sup>3</sup>). In addition, regional differences were observed with regard to the structure of the population. In the southern Yellow Sea, C5 accounted for 77.4% of the total population in the YSCBW, while C5 and females contributed to 32.3% and 51.8%, respectively, out of the YSCBW. In the East China Sea, the structure of the population was similar to that outside the YSCBW with 33.2% of C5 and 41.3% females. The results of the abundance and structure of the population indicate that the area near the shore of the East China Sea may also act as a preservation area for C. sinicus in summer along with the YSCBW. The total lipid content in female C. sinicus was approximately 5.4\u201417.2% of their dry body mass, while C5 had higher lipid content (22.4%\u201440.1%). The lipid content of C5 in the YSCBW was 43.1 \u03bcg/ ind, while the lipid content of the females in the YSCBW (mean, 24.6 \u03bcg/ ind) and at the area near the shore of the East China Sea (mean, 18.2 \u03bcg/ ind) was lower than C5 in YSCBW. The major lipid classes were wax ester and phospholipid and together they comprise of approximately 90% to the total lipid content. The C5 in the YSCBW can survive longer (18 days) than C.sinicus in other areas (\u22646 days) by utilizing the lipid content as their sole energy source for their basic metabolic needs. However, this is still insufficient for successful over-summering of C.sinicus. The C5 in the YSCBW can use stored lipid and sustain on a limited food supply during over-summering, while C. sinicus in other areas require active feeding to survive during the summer.", "pid": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1517979d"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Xiaoying Yao", "org": "Department of Neurology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Ren Ji Hospital", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e151322af"}, {"name": "Quan Dong", "org": "Department of Neurology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Ren Ji Hospital", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150a8559"}, {"name": "Yeping Song", "org": "Department of Neurology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Ren Ji Hospital", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e15094ffe"}, {"name": "Yanqing Wang", "org": "Department of Neurology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Ren Ji Hospital", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fa8924"}, {"name": "Ye Deng", "org": "Department of Neurology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Ren Ji Hospital", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e15094fc7"}, {"name": "Yansheng Li", "org": "Department of Neurology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Ren Ji Hospital", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ff5176"}], "title": "Thrombelastography maximal clot strength could predict one-year functional outcome in patients with ischemic stroke", "keywords": ["Clinical outcome", "Ischemic stroke", "Maximal clot strength", "Maximum amplitude", "Thrombelastography"], "venue": "Cerebrovascular Diseases", "year": 2014, "abstract": "Background: Elevated maximal clot strength, measured by thrombelastography (TEG) maximum amplitude (MA) has been associated with a higher risk for ischemic events in patients with coronary artery diseases.

Male C57/BL6 mice received quercetin continuously from 2 weeks prior to and 6 weeks following the AAA induction with extraluminal CaCl2. Quercetin treatment decreased AAA incidence and inhibited the reactive oxygen species generation, nitrotyrosine formation and lipid peroxidation production in the aortic tissue during AAA development. In addition, quercetin-treated mice exhibited significantly lower expression of the p47phox subunit of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase and inducible nitric oxide synthase, as well as coordinated downregulation of manganese-superoxide dismutase activities and glutathione peroxidase (GPx)-1 and GPx-3 expression. Quercetin also blunted the expression of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and phospho-JNK and, in addition, diminished activation of the activator protein (AP)-1 transcription factor. Gelatin zymography showed that quercetin eliminated matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 activation during AAA formation.

The unit cell is composed of a two-layer periodic H-shape structure loaded with varactors. By tuning the bias voltage applied to the varactors, the unit cell has two different states that are transparent and absorptive to the incident wave at a certain frequency, respectively. We can control the transparent region of the whole FSS through reasonably setting the capacitance of the varactor loaded on each unit cell, and thus the beamwidth of the transmitted wave could be tuned. The above property has been validated by putting the FSS above the horn antenna array as superstrate. Simulation results show that E-plane beamwidth of the antenna can be enlarged from 13.2\u00b0 to 31.1\u00b0 at 5.5 GHz, and experimental results agree well with the simulated ones.

Due to the fact that AD has a long period of incubation before clinical symptoms emerge, the available therapeutic treatments can only improve the symptoms but not delay the progression of AD. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore effective diagnostic approaches to catch and better treat the disease before clinical symptoms appear. Recent research revealed that abnormal expression of certain miRNA could have a crucial role in the pathological process of neurodegenerative disease including AD. Furthermore, given that AD patients show increased level of miRNAs in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid, miRNAs are considered promising non-invasive candidates for AD diagnosis and prognosis.

During the cooling process, some hexagonal islands randomly appear in the liquid first, then grow up to grain nuclei, and finally connect together to form a complete polycrystalline film.

However, the GUM may encounter problems and does not work well when the measurement data have poor information. In most cases, poor information means a small data sample and an unknown probability distribution. In these cases, the evaluation of measurement uncertainty has become a bottleneck in practical measurement. To solve this problem, a novel method called the grey relational approach (GRA), different from the statistical theory, is proposed in this paper. The GRA does not require a large sample size or probability distribution information of the measurement data. Mathematically, the GRA can be divided into three parts. Firstly, according to grey relational analysis, the grey relational coefficients between the ideal and the practical measurement output series are obtained. Secondly, the weighted coefficients and the measurement expectation function will be acquired based on the grey relational coefficients. Finally, the measurement uncertainty is evaluated based on grey modeling. In order to validate the performance of this method, simulation experiments were performed and the evaluation results show that the GRA can keep the average error around 5%. Besides, the GRA was also compared with the grey method, the Bessel method, and the Monte Carlo method by a real stress measurement. Both the simulation experiments and real measurement show that the GRA is appropriate and effective to evaluate the measurement uncertainty with poor information.", "pid": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f9a4db"}]}
