This is because it is expected to balance accuracy and robustness of SDM models. However, there are little available data regarding the spatial similarity of the combined distribution maps generated by different consensus approaches. Here, using eight niche-based models, nine split-sample calibration bouts (or nine random model-training subsets), and nine climate change scenarios, the distributions of 32 forest tree species in China were simulated under current and future climate conditions. The forecasting ensembles were combined to determine final consensual prediction maps for target species using three simple consensus approaches (average, frequency, and median [PCA]). Species' geographic ranges changed (area change and shifting distance) in response to climate change, but the three consensual projections did not differ significantly with respect to how much or in which direction, but they did differ with respect to the spatial similarity of the three consensual predictions. Incongruent areas were observed primarily at the edges of species' ranges. Multiple stepwise regression models showed the three factors (niche marginality and specialization, and niche model accuracy) to be related to the observed variations in consensual prediction maps among consensus approaches. Spatial correspondence among prediction maps was the highest when niche model accuracy was high and marginality and specialization were low. The difference in spatial predictions suggested that more attention should be paid to the range of spatial uncertainty before any decisions regarding specialist species can be made based on map outputs. The niche properties and single-model predictive performance provide promising insights that may further understanding of uncertainties in SDM.", "pid": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ff2c52"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Xinle Hua", "org": "Hebei Electric Power Company", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150b2f0b"}, {"name": "Qian Zhang", "org": "Hebei Electric Power Company", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e15071ee1"}, {"name": "Wenjie Fu", "org": "Hebei Electric Power Company", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1515e2bb"}, {"name": "Xudong Zhang", "org": "Hebei Electric Power Company", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ff3f5b"}, {"name": "Shi Wang", "org": "Hebei Electric Power Company", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1504004a"}, {"name": "Qingliang Wang", "org": "Hebei Electric Power Company", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150c89c2"}, {"name": "Jun Li", "org": "Hebei Electric Power Company", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150e8a64"}], "title": "A global heuristic and two-tier algorithm to solve power cable optimal cutting problem", "keywords": ["Cable optimized cutting", "Cloud computing platform", "Cutting oddments concentration", "Global heuristic and two-tier algorithm", "Optimal solution"], "venue": "Dianwang Jishu/Power System Technology", "year": 2012, "abstract": "A global heuristic two-tier algorithm to solve the problem of power cable optimal cutting is proposed.

Based on the proposed algorithm a calculation platform for power cable optimal cutting is developed and the solutions of this platform can meet the requirement of cable cutting accurately and original scattered short oddments of power cables after traditional cutting can be highly centralized to a single cable as a whole, besides, needing not adjustment, the developed calculation platform can be directly applied. Both results from actual application and calculation examples show that the proposed algorithm possesses the advantages of high computing speed, satisfied solution quality, and under normal circumstances ideal optimal solution can be obtained, thus the proposed algorithm is significant to the saving of the usage amount of power cable and the reduction of the cost of power construction.

Besides being degraded through the endolysosomal pathway, the DTX-loaded H40-PLA NPs were also sequestered by autophagosomes and degraded through the autolysosomal pathway. DTX-loaded H40-PLA NPs may stop exerting beneficial effects after inducing autophagy of human MCF-7 cancer cells.

RESULTS: We discovered three lncRNA, RP11-160H22.5, XLOC_014172 and LOC149086, which were up-regulated in HCC comparing with the cancer-free controls with the merged area under curve (AUC) in training set and validation set of 0.999 and 0.896. Furthermore, XLOC_014172 and LOC149086 was confirmed highly increased in metastasis HCC patients with the merged AUC in training set and validation set of 0.900 and 0.934.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of truncated isoform of protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor-type O (PTPROt) in T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity. We recruited 70 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients and 30 healthy volunteers for clinical investigation, and analyzed cellular tumor immunity by using ptpro<sup>-/-</sup> C57BL/6 mice and NOD/SCID mice. PTPROt expression was significantly downregulated in human HCC-infiltrating T cells due to the hypoxia microenvironment; PTPROt expression highly correlated with the intratumoral Teff/Treg ratio and clinicopathologic characteristics. Moreover, PTPROt deficiency attenuated T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity and remarkably promoted mouse HCC growth. Mechanistically, deletion of PTPROt decreased Teff quantity and quality through phosphorylation of lymphocyte-specific tyrosine kinase, but increased Treg differentiation through phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5.

As a result, a novel criterion called shot reconstruction degree (SRD) is proposed for key frame selection based on the degree of retaining motion dynamics of a video shot. Compared with the widely used fidelity criterion, the key frame set produced by SRD can better capture the detailed dynamics of the shot. Using the new SRD criterion, a novel inflexion-based key frame selection algorithm is developed. Simulation results show that the new algorithm results in good performance in terms of both fidelity and shot reconstruction degree. \u00a9 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The use of resynchronization marks is an efficient method in improving the error resilient performance of a video stream in error-prone environment. In this paper, a smart macroblock rearrangement (SMR) method is proposed to enhance the performance of the resynchronization mark insertion technique for intracoded frames in wireless video transmission. The proposed method makes use of content analysis to rearrange and encode macroblocks between adjacent resynchronization marks. Experiments using the SMR method in both H.263+ and H.264 codecs show that the proposed method outperforms some existing algorithms in both PSNR performance and visual quality. \u00a9 2008 Elsevier Inc.

And when this happens, the rock collapses, then it is impossible to use the conventional Kaiser Effect to measure the in-situ stresses. So under the above conditions the conventional Kaiser Effect of rock becomes ineffective. In this paper, the in-situ stress measurement by Kaiser Effect of rock samples under confining pressures is performed. And an experimental method of measuring in-situ stresses with Kaiser Effect of rock samples under confining pressure is proposed, as well as the experimental principles. The conclusion is that the Kaiser stresses of rock are proportional to the confining pressures, and the statistical regression relationship is obtained.

The different magnitude of acoustic velocity around the surface of core cylinder is caused by the different degree of unloading on the core. The magnitude of acoustic velocity is the minimum in the direction of maximum in-situ stress, and the maximum in the direction of minimum stress. Based on this principle, the relative position of the maximum and minimum horizontal principal in-situ stresses can be determined. Then the acoustic emission experiments are performed on the two core samples drilled from the certain position, and the horizontal in-situ stress state is determined. The advantage of this method is that the experiment can be performed on thin layer core instead of an integral core of 15 cm long without any fracture, and can improve measurement of in-situ stresses at great depth.", "pid": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f5d51e"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Yingying Cui", "org": "Department of Oncology", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f5b5a1"}, {"name": "Xin Li", "org": "Department of Oncology", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150c6d3e"}, {"name": "Zhenchang Sun", "org": "Department of Oncology", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fea183"}, {"name": "Changsen Leng", "org": "Affiliated Cancer Hospital", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1503ae97"}, {"name": "Ken Young", "org": "Department of Hematopathology", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15022c58"}, {"name": "Xiaolong Wu", "org": "Department of Oncology", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e15042228"}, {"name": "Lei Zhang", "org": "Department of Oncology", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e15083067"}, {"name": "Xiaorui Fu", "org": "Department of Oncology", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1504b1ce"}, {"name": "Ling Li", "org": "Department of Oncology", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fedb7c"}, {"name": "Xudong Zhang", "org": "Department of Oncology", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fc8336"}, {"name": "Yu Chang", "org": "Department of Oncology", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1514ffb7"}, {"name": "Feifei Nan", "org": "Department of Oncology", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150ba9ab"}, {"name": "Zhaoming Li", "org": "Department of Oncology", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e15203629"}, {"name": "Jiaqin Yan", "org": "Department of Oncology", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150ba50e"}, {"name": "Zhiyuan Zhou", "org": "Department of Oncology", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e15188715"}, {"name": "Mingzhi Zhang", "org": "Department of Oncology", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f8e169"}, {"name": "Wencai Li", "org": "Department of Pathology", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e15178c87"}, {"name": "Guannan Wang", "org": "Department of Pathology", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1507b384"}, {"name": "Dandan Zhang", "org": "Department of Pathology", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e15163835"}], "title": "Safety and efficacy of low-dose pre-phase before conventional-dose chemotherapy for ulcerative gastric diffuse large B-cell lymphoma", "keywords": ["Chemotherapy", "complication", "gastric lymphoma", "ulcer"], "venue": "Leukemia and Lymphoma", "year": 2015, "abstract": "Potentially fatal chemotherapy (CT)-related gastrorrhagia and gastric perforation in patients with gastric lymphoma present difficult problems to doctors.
