In this paper, taking the economy, environmental protection performance and speediness of load dispatching under dynamic operation condition as optimizing objects, the load dispatching is optimized. For this purpose, an improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, which integrates generalized Lagrange multiplier with traditional PSO algorithm, is proposed to process the optimization model.

A combination of novel polymer development, nanoscale morphology control and processing optimization has led to over 8% power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) for BHJ PSCs with a conventional device structure. Attempts to develop PSCs with an inverted device structure as required for achieving high PECs and good stability have, however, met with limited success. Here, we report that a high PCE of 8.4% under AM 1.5G irradiation was achieved for BHJ PSCs with an inverted device structure. This high efficiency was obtained through interfacial engineering of solution-processed electron extraction layer, leading to facilitate electron transport and suppress bimolecular recombination. These results provided an important progress for solution-processed PSCs, and demonstrated that PSCs with an inverted device structure are comparable with PSCs with the conventional device structure. \u00a9  The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012.", "pid": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1508dc2d"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Kan Zheng", "org": "Ctr. of Wireless Commun.", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e150481c4"}, {"name": "Lin Huang", "org": "Ctr. of Wireless Commun.", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1508e14d"}, {"name": "Wen-Bo Wang", "org": "Ctr. of Wireless Commun.", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150ecef8"}], "title": "A novel pre-compensation scheme in uplink MC-CDMA/TDD systems", "keywords": ["MC-CDMA", "Pre-compensation", "Time Division Duplex (TDD)", "Uplink"], "venue": "Dianzi Yu Xinxi Xuebao/Journal of Electronics and Information Technology", "year": 2005, "abstract": "This paper presents a novel power-limited pre-compensation method in MC-CDMA/TDD systems, which can avoid pilot insertion on the uplink and increase the spectral/power efficiency.

However, the underlying mechanism of CS-6 involved in anti-tumor activity remains poorly understood. Methods: The biological functions of gamabufotalin (CS-6) were investigated by migration, colony formation and apoptosis assays in NSCLC cells. The nuclear localization and interaction between transcriptional co-activator p300 and NF-\u03baB p50/p65 and their binding to COX-2 promoter were analyzed after treatment with CS-6. Molecular docking study was used to simulate the interaction of CS-6 with IKK\u00df. The in vivo anti-tumor efficacy of CS-6 was also analyzed in xenografts nude mice. Western blot was used to detect the protein expression level. Results: Gamabufotalin (CS-6) strongly suppressed COX-2 expression by inhibiting the phosphorylation of IKK\u00df via targeting the ATP-binding site, thereby abrogating NF-\u03baB binding and p300 recruitment to COX-2 promoter. In addition, CS-6 induced apoptosis by activating the cytochrome c and caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway. Moreover, CS-6 markedly down-regulated the protein levels of COX-2 and phosphorylated p65 NF-\u03baB in tumor tissues of the xenograft mice, and inhibited tumor weight and size. Conclusions: Our study provides pharmacological evidence that CS-6 exhibits potential use in the treatment of COX-2-mediated diseases such as lung cancer.", "pid": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1506b3ab"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Li Li", "org": "Chengdu Institute of Biological Products Co., Ltd.", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151af85e"}, {"name": "Liang-Yu Hou", "org": "Chengdu Institute of Biological Products Co., Ltd.", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151ca86f"}, {"name": "Guang Ma", "org": "Chengdu Institute of Biological Products Co., Ltd.", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e151fb0ea"}, {"name": "Xiu-Hong Ding", "org": "Chengdu Institute of Biological Products Co., Ltd.", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150a7d77"}, {"name": "Yong-Zhong Li", "org": "Chengdu Institute of Biological Products Co., Ltd.", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e15069f8e"}, {"name": "Xiu-Jie Ha", "org": "Chengdu Institute of Biological Products Co., Ltd.", "id": "5b5433e3e1cd8e4e15f44457"}, {"name": "Hao Zeng", "org": "Chengdu Institute of Biological Products Co., Ltd.", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1514a1a1"}, {"name": "Yi Li", "org": "Chengdu Institute of Biological Products Co., Ltd.", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f9b222"}, {"name": "Wei-Ran Zou", "org": "Chengdu Institute of Biological Products Co., Ltd.", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e15043da6"}, {"name": "Chong-Jian Lin", "org": "Chengdu Institute of Biological Products Co., Ltd.", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151d1365"}, {"name": "Yu-Jie Shan", "org": "Chengdu Institute of Biological Products Co., Ltd.", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1508fddb"}, {"name": "Ye Liu", "org": "Chengdu Institute of Biological Products Co., Ltd.", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1505d4d0"}, {"name": "Lin Huang", "org": "Chengdu Institute of Biological Products Co., Ltd.", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1515cfa5"}], "title": "Live attenuated varicella vaccines (VZV 84-7 strain) prepared by various processes", "keywords": ["Cell factory", "Human diploid cells (2BS strain)", "Live attenuated varicella vaccine"], "venue": "Chinese Journal of Biologicals", "year": 2015, "abstract": "Objective: To prepare live attenuated varicella vaccines (VZV 84-7 strain) by cell factory instead of traditional roller system. Methods: Six batches of 2BS cells were cultured in cell factory and 3 L roller separately, and counted by fully automatic Countstar cell counter, based on which the cell quality was evaluated by the cell count in unit area, survival rate and mean cell diameter after digestion. Meanwhile, the heat stability of vaccines were evaluated by determination of virus titers in bulk, final bulk and final product after storage at 37 \u00b0C for 7 d by plaque assay. Results: The mean count in unit area and mean survival rate of six batches of cells prepared by cell factory were slightly higher, while the change range of mean diameter was less than those by culture in 3 L roller.

Increased production of IL-1\u03b2 in pain and inflammation such as headache is well documented. However, limited evidence addresses the participation of inflammasomes in inflammatory pain. The present study used rat inflammatory dural stimulation-induced model of intracranial pain to assess whether headache-related pain can induce the activation of NACHT, LRR, and PYD-containing protein (NALP)-3 inflammasome pathway in the trigeminal ganglia (TG) and which cells express NALP3 inflammasome proteins and IL-1\u03b2. Chemical stimulation of the intracranial dura caused a total drug dose- and time-dependent induction of activated caspase-1 and mature IL-1\u03b2 proteins. Application of a selective caspase-1 inhibitor diminished these effects. Immunohistochemistry revealed that both NALP3 inflammasome and IL-1\u03b2 immunoreactivity were existed mainly in small to medium-sized C-type neurons and increased over time, with intense cytoplasmic staining after 3 days of dural inflammation. Overall, the present observation indicated that dural inflammation promoted assembly of the multiprotein NALP3 complex, activated caspase-1, and induced processing of IL-1\u03b2, which provides an indirect evidence of the participation of NALP3 inflammasome in the cascade of events involved in the genesis of headaches by promoting IL-1\u03b2 maturation in the TG. This may contribute to strategies for headache control. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier B.V.", "pid": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f681da"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Xin Cheng", "org": "Nanchang Key Laboratory of Applied Fermentation Technology", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151f2972"}, {"name": "Lin Huang", "org": "Nanchang Key Laboratory of Applied Fermentation Technology", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ff6ea1"}, {"name": "Xiao-rong Tu", "org": "Nanchang Key Laboratory of Applied Fermentation Technology", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150a008e"}, {"name": "Kun-tai Li", "org": "Nanchang Key Laboratory of Applied Fermentation Technology", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e15145e41"}], "title": "Medium optimization for the feather-degradation by Streptomyces fradiae Var S-221 using the response surface methodology", "keywords": ["Amino acid", "Feather-biodegradation", "Medium optimization", "Response surface methodology", "Streptomyces fradiae VarS-221"], "venue": "Biodegradation", "year": 2009, "abstract": "In order to accelerate biodegradation of feather into more amino acids, the fermentation medium of feather-biodegrading Streptomyces fradiaeVarS-221 was optimized in this paper.

Production of seamless steel tube is characterized as follows: (1) rolling batch is considered as a job to be scheduled; (2) the production process consists of multiple stages; (3) different setup times are required for different rolling batches to be processed; and (4) product variety is frequently changed on the same equipment. This paper takes the Tianjin Seamless Steel Tube Company (China) as the research background. The seamless Steel Tube Scheduling (SSTS) problem can be viewed as a flowshop scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setup times. The objective is to minimize the makespan considering rolling batches to be scheduled. For a small-scale problem, an optimal solution to the problem is found using a branch-and-bound method in which the lower bound is determined according to the mth (the last) machine in the flowshop scheduling. For a large-scale problem, a near-optimal solution to the problem is found by two-stage heuristic algorithms based on a neighborhood search method. Finally, the proposed optimal and approximate algorithms are implemented on a computer using Microsoft VC++6.0. A computational experiment with a large amount of randomly generated problem instances is designed to compare the performance of the algorithms. The following results can be drawn from the computer simulation experiments. For a small-scale problem, the proposed branch-and-bound can yield an optimal solution. The best heuristics can yield a near-optimal solution with an average 0.8% deviation from the optimal solution within a reasonable time. \u00a9 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The fundamental idea is to make an elaborate use of the natural growth and decay mechanism inherent in the structure of a dynamical systems to decompose its dynamics into increase and decrease parts, and thereby to constitute an augmented dynamical system as the so-called \"two-sided comparison system\" of the original one. The corresponding two-sided comparison theorems show that the solution of the comparison system gives lower and upper bounds of that of the original system. Therefore, the properties of a dynamical system can be obtained through the study of its two-sided comparison system. Compared with the conventional comparison method in literature, the mixed monotone decomposition method developed herein takes in a natural way structural properties of dynamical systems into account instead of requiring strict conditions of (quasi-)monotonicity on them, and could yields refined, usually nonsymmetrical, state estimates, and thus is more suitable for systems with nonsymmetrical state constraints. As an application of the method, a sufficient condition is established for the global asymptotic stability of the trivial solution of a class of continuous-time systems with nonsymmetrical state saturation.

Furthermore, we investigate the transitions of firing synchronization characterized by the rate of firing when the coupling strength is increased. It is found that there exists an intermediate coupling strength; firing synchronization is minimal simultaneously irrespective of the size of networks.

Several examples are then provided to show that adding new edges to a network can either increase or decrease the network synchronizability. In searching for conditions under which the network synchronizability may be increased by adding edges, it is found that for networks with disconnected complementary graphs, adding edges never decreases their synchronizability. Moreover, it is found that an unbounded synchronized region is always easier to analyze than a bounded synchronized region. Therefore to effectively enhance the network synchronizability, a design method is finally presented for the inner linking matrix of rank 1 such that the resultant network has an unbounded synchronized region, for the case where the synchronous state is an equilibrium point of the network. \u00a9 2007 The American Physical Society.", "pid": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fcecec"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Zhisheng Duan", "org": "State Key Laboratory for Turbulence and Complex Systems", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150a3981"}, {"name": "Jinzhi Wang", "org": "State Key Laboratory for Turbulence and Complex Systems", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150a669d"}, {"name": "Rong Li", "org": "State Key Laboratory for Turbulence and Complex Systems", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e15144984"}, {"name": "Lin Huang", "org": "State Key Laboratory for Turbulence and Complex Systems", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ff6ea1"}], "title": "A generalization of smooth Chua's equations under lagrange stability", "keywords": ["Interconnected systems", "Lagrange stability", "Nonlinearly coupled Chua's circuit", "Smooth Chua's equation"], "venue": "International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos", "year": 2007, "abstract": "In this paper, smooth Chua's equation is generalized to a higher order system from a special viewpoint of interconnected systems.

The fluorescence of propidium iodide (PI) staining was used for quantification of cellular survival, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in incubation medium was assessed by LDH assay to evaluate the degree of injury. 3. The OGD ischemic condition significantly decreased cellular viability and increased LDH release in the incubation medium. CP (0.2 mg/l\u223c2 mg/l) protected brain slices from OGD injury in a dosage dependent manner as demonstrated by increased A 490 value of TTC, decreased PI intensity and LDH release. At the above concentration, CP also prevented the increase of nitric oxide (NO) content and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activity induced by OGD. 4. CP can protect the brain slices (cortical and hippocampus) against injury induced by OGD. Its neuroprotective effect may be partly mediated by the NO/iNOS system induced by OGD insult. \u00a9 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.", "pid": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e15143035"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Pingli Lu", "org": "State Key Lab for Turbulence and Complex Systems", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fc2b10"}, {"name": "Ying Yang", "org": "State Key Lab for Turbulence and Complex Systems", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151e7ab3"}, {"name": "Lin Huang", "org": "State Key Lab for Turbulence and Complex Systems", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ff6ea1"}], "title": "Dynamic feedback control for cycle slipping in a phase-controlled system", "keywords": ["Cycle slipping", "LMI", "Phase-locked loop"], "venue": "Nonlinear Analysis, Theory, Methods and Applications", "year": 2008, "abstract": "This paper concerns the problem of cycle slipping for continuous phase-controlled systems with periodic nonlinearity.

In this study, hydroxyfasudil, a Rho-kinase inhibitor, was found to improve the learning and memory performance significantly in rats with ischemia induced by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion after permanent bilateral carotid artery ligation (BCAL). This was observed by the administration of hydroxyfasudil (1 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg, once per day for 30 days) to ischemic rats and the measurements of escape latency and time spent in the target quadrant among the ischemic, sham, and ischemic plus hydroxyfasudil rats by the method of Morris water maze. (2) In electrophysiological study, hydroxyfasudil abolished the inhibition of long-term potentiation (LTP) in rats with ischemia. Morphologically, it also markedly reduced pathological changes such as neuronal cells loss and nuclei shrinkage in cortex and hippocampus of ischemic rats. Biochemical analysis showed that the inhibition of Rho-kinase by hydroxyfasudil reduced the amount of MDA and increased the activities of SOD and GPx in ischemic rats that had increased MDA and decreased SOD and GPx activities. (3) To explore mechanism (s) of the beneficial effects of hydroxyfasudil in ischemia, we performed immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR analyses of NMDA NR2B subunit and for the first time found that hydroxyfasudil increased the expression of NR2B in cortex and hippocampus at both protein and mRNA levels.

Methods: Seventy male wistar rats were fed with a high-fat and high-caloric diet to establish insulin resistance model. After 8 weeks' feeding, serum fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting insulin(Fins), insulin sensitivity index(ISI) were determined. Forty-two insulin resistant rats were successfully induced and were randomly divided into model, berberine and alpha-lipoic acid(ALA) groups, with 14 animals in each group. Another 12 normal rats were used as control group. After administration with corresponding drugs for 4 weeks, the rats were sacrificed and serum malonaldehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were determined. The GRP78 mRNA expression in liver was determined by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Western blot analysis was employed to detect liver Phospho-c-Jun/JNK protein expression. Results: Compared with control group, model group showed higher MDA level while significantly decreased SOD and GSH-Px activity (P < 0.05). In berberine and ALA groups, SOD and GSH-Px were elevated drastically compared to those of model group (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05), while MDA level was significantly decreased compared with that of model group. Protein expression of Phospho-c-Jun/JNK in model group was significantly higher than that in control group while its expression in berberine group was significantly decreased than that in model group (P < 0.01). The GRP78/ Bip mRNA was significantly increased in model group (P < 0.05), while obviously decreased in berberine and ALA groups compared with normal control.

The spacecraft attitude determination is a nonlinear/non-Gaussian state filtering problem, so to use the classical filters proposed based on the extended Kalman filter (EKF) or unscented Kalman filter (UKF) might fail, especially when an accurate initial aprior state estimate is unexpectable. Recently the particle filtering algorithms have been applied to spacecraft attitude determination. However some algorithms need a large number of state particles. This is a heavy burden for the computers with limited capabilities. This paper is aimed to release the heavy burden by using dual-filter method, which temporally decomposed the attitude estimation from the rate gyro drift rate bias estimation at each iteration. Two novel filters including a modified dual particle filter (DPF) and a new hybrid filter (HF) are proposed. Both filters use a same quaternion particle filter which is a modification of a recently proposed algorithm, by using a slightly different resampling and regularizing algorithm. The DPF uses an auxiliary particle bias filter, whereas the HF uses a UKF bias filter.

The statistical analysis result was as follows: TT+CT vs. CC: fixed effect model OR=0.76, 95% CI: 0.63~0.91; random effect model OR=0.70, 95% CI: 0.52~0.93, TT vs. CC+CT: fixed effect model OR=0.90, 95% CI: 0.70~1.15; random effect model OR=0.93, 95% CI: 0.53~1.61. The bias examined by graph of the funnel plot showed no significance. Three studies involving MTHFR C677T gene polymorphism and toxicity of MTX chemotherapy consisted of 138 cases. The statistical analysis result was as follows: TT+CT vs. CC: fixed effect model OR=0.90, 95% CI: 0.70~1.15; random effect model OR=2.96, 95% CI: 0.66~13.32, TT vs. CC+CT: fixed effect model OR=2.68, 95% CI: 1.14~6.29; random effect model OR=3.31, 95% CI: 0.57~19.21. Conclution: The mutation of MTHFR 677C\u2192T is a protective factor of ALL development, while there is no correlation between MTHFR 677TT genotype and ALL risk. There is no correlation between MTHFR genetic polymorphism and toxicity of MTX chemotherapy. Further study with a large number of samples is needed for more reliable conclusions.", "pid": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fb16be"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Lina Zheng", "org": "Department of Biotechnology", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e15048c94"}, {"name": "Xiang Zhou", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Microbial Metabolism and School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1511f378"}, {"name": "Huaidong Zhang", "org": "Department of Biotechnology", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f5ac78"}, {"name": "Xiaofeng Ji", "org": "Yellow Sea Fisheries Research Institute", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f59254"}, {"name": "Lei Li", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Microbial Metabolism and School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fab056"}, {"name": "Lin Huang", "org": "Department of Biotechnology", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ff6ea1"}, {"name": "Linquan Bai", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Microbial Metabolism and School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fbb772"}, {"name": "Houjin Zhang", "org": "Department of Biotechnology", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150c163b"}], "title": "Structural and functional analysis of validoxylamine a 7\u2032-phosphate synthase ValL involved in validamycin a biosynthesis", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "year": 2012, "abstract": "Validamycin A (Val-A) is an effective antifungal agent widely used in Asian countries as crop protectant.

The colorimetric sensor array, with specific colorific fingerprint to the VOCs in vinegar, was successfully used to monitor vinegar acetic fermentation with the help of multivariate calibration. Principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA), as two multivariate calibration tools, were used to classify vinegar samples at different acetic fermentation stages.

The purpose of this work was to provide an assessment of the performance of LIBS in investigating heavy metals in natural organic materials through a direct comparison of the analytical results. The LIBS spectra of samples were collected by optimized experimental parameters and the characteristic spectral lines of two triplet bands at 357.87 nm, 359.35 nm and 360.53 nm and 425.43 nm, 427.48 nm and 428.97 nm were identified distinctly. The Cr I 425.43 nm was selected as analytical line. The concentrations of Cr element were determined by AAS. The relative standard deviation (RSD) values were analyzed and the results demonstrated that there are much more room to promote in LIBS measuring. The calibration curve between the LIBS intensity and AAS concentration was constructed about Cr element. The results show LIBS signal intensity linear dependence on the concentration of Cr. Quantitative analytical results by the curve were validated with AAS measurements. The presented results showed that the standard deviations of the LIBS measurements are in general much larger than those of AAS measurements. Mostly, this contributes to matrix effect of samples and instability of LIBS. In a word, the obtained results between LIBS and AAS demonstrate the capacity of LIBS in the determination of the concentrations of Cr in oranges. Further work are being continued in our laboratory for further improvement of the sensitivity of LIBS, and for direct analysis of heavy metals in natural agricultural products without contamination treatment. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.", "pid": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151dd684"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Mingyin Yao", "org": "Optics-Electronics Application of Biomaterials Lab", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e151736df"}, {"name": "Muhua Liu", "org": "Optics-Electronics Application of Biomaterials Lab", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fe181c"}, {"name": "Yuan Xu", "org": "Optics-Electronics Application of Biomaterials Lab", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151bd8d0"}, {"name": "Zejian Lei", "org": "Optics-Electronics Application of Biomaterials Lab", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e15186d22"}, {"name": "Lin Huang", "org": "College of Biological Science and Engineering", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ff6ea1"}], "title": "Determination of Cu in fishpond water by laser induced breakdown spectroscopy", "keywords": ["Cu", "Fishpond water", "LIBS", "Rapid detection"], "venue": "Laser and Tera-Hertz Science and Technology, LTST 2012", "year": 2012, "abstract": "Heavy metals produce serious environmental pollution and cause actual harm to the health of people.

In summary, antifungalmycin 702 may exert its antifungal activity against R. solani by changing the structure of cell membranes and the cytoskeleton and interacting with the organelles. \u00a9 2013 Xiong et al.", "pid": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151edc09"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Lin Huang", "org": "College of Biological Science and Engineering", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ff6ea1"}, {"name": "Jiewen Zhao", "org": "College of Biological Science and Engineering", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1511f09b"}, {"name": "Quansheng Chen", "org": "College of Biological Science and Engineering", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e15073a1b"}, {"name": "Yanhua Zhang", "org": "College of Biological Science and Engineering", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150baf9a"}], "title": "Nondestructive measurement of total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N) in pork meat by integrating near infrared spectroscopy, computer vision and electronic nose techniques", "keywords": ["Computer vision (CV)", "Data fusion", "Electronic nose (E-nose)", "Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)", "Total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N)"], "venue": "Food Chemistry", "year": 2014, "abstract": "Total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N) content is an important reference index for evaluating pork freshness. This paper attempted to measure TVB-N content in pork meat using integrating near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), computer vision (CV), and electronic nose (E-nose) techniques. In the experiment, 90 pork samples with different freshness were collected for data acquisition by three different techniques, respectively. Then, the individual characteristic variables were extracted from each sensor. Next, principal component analysis (PCA) was used to achieve data fusion based on these characteristic variables from 3 different sensors data. Back-propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN) was used to construct the model for TVB-N content prediction, and the top principal components (PCs) were extracted as the input of model. The result of the model was achieved as follows: the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) = 2.73 mg/100 g and the determination coefficient (Rp2)=0.9527 in the prediction set. Compared with single technique, integrating three techniques, in this paper, has its own superiority. This work demonstrates that it has the potential in nondestructive detection of TVB-N content in pork meat using integrating NIRS, CV and E-nose, and data fusion from multi-technique could significantly improve TVB-N prediction performance. \u00a9 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.", "pid": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151dc0c8"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Lin Huang", "org": "College of Biological Science and Engineering", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ff6ea1"}, {"name": "Jiewen Zhao", "org": "School of Food and Biological Engineering", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1511f09b"}, {"name": "Quansheng Chen", "org": "School of Food and Biological Engineering", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e15073a1b"}, {"name": "Yanhua Zhang", "org": "School of Food and Biological Engineering", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150baf9a"}], "title": "Rapid detection of total viable count (TVC) in pork meat by hyperspectral imaging", "keywords": ["Detection", "Hyperspectral imaging", "Pork meat", "Total viable count (TVC)"], "venue": "Food Research International", "year": 2013, "abstract": "Total viable count (TVC) of bacteria is one of the most important indexes in evaluation of quality and safety of meat.

The dissolution vugs, the dissolution pores and microfractures in matrix provide storage space for fluid. One of the interesting problems is how to define vug and pore in the discipline of flow mechanics. The goal of this study was to propose a method to determine the size limit between dissolution pores and dissolution vugs. First, using a vuggy-fracture-matrix conceptual model for triple medium, a typical single-phase radial flowed into a well with constant production rate was analyzed. The analytical solution was obtained by use of Laplace transform and numerical Laplace invers method. The characteristics of the pressure derivative curve for triple medium were investigated.

The problem of robust controller synthesis is concerned with designing a feedback controller such that the resulting closed-loop system is gradient-like for all admissible uncertainties.

Previous studies have shown that extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN) in tumor cells induces the synthesis of MMPs. EMMPRIN is abundantly present on the surface of tumor cells and stimulate adjacent stromal cells to synthesize MMPs to induce tumor progression. Giant cell tumor (GCT) of bone is a benign but locally aggressive primary neoplasm of bone. The spindle-shaped mononuclear stromal cells are considered to be the tumor components of GCT, which are capable of inducing osteoclast formation by recruiting the circulating monocyte and macrophage. In this study, we proposed that EMMPRIN is associated with the biological progression and aggressiveness of GCT. We have conducted semi-quantitative RT-PCR to determine the correlation of EMMPRIN expression with the clinical stage of GCT. We have also examined the cellular localization of EMMPRIN in GCT using in-situ hybridization (ISH) and Immunohistochemistry (IH). The results showed that EMMPRIN was present in GCT and its mRNA levels were associated with the clinical stage of GCT. Higher expression level of EMMPRIN was observed in GCT with advanced stage (stage III). There was a great significance (P<0.05) of EMMPRIN expression between stage I & II and stage III GCTs. Both ISH and IH demonstrated that EMMPRIN is present at the multinuclear osteoclast-like giant cells of GCT, with strong immunostaining on the cell membrane. The stromal-like tumor cells were also positively stained but the intensity was weaker. Interestingly, the production of EMMPRIN in osteoclast-like cells of GCT seems to be regulated by stromal-like tumor cells. Receptor activator of NF-\u03baB ligand (RANKL), which has been previously shown to be produced by the stromal-like tumor cells for the recruitment of osteoclast-like giant cells in GCT, enhanced the expression of EMMPRIN mRNA during the differentiation of macrophage-like RAW", "pid": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f8da5b"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Yuen-Y.

The authors studied the apoptosis and ultrastructural changes induced in osteoclast-like giant cells of GCT, following treatment with the aminobisphosphonate pamidronate in 16 patients with GCT of bone. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to identify ultrastructural changes, indicative of apoptosis, in the cytoplasm and the nucleus of the giant cells. Significant changes were observed in tumor samples from all 16 patients. In the cytoplasm these changes were characterized by abundant large tubular vesicles containing a central electrodense core scattered through the cytoplasm. In addition, mitochondria in the sections from pamidronate-treated patients appeared to be edematous when compared with sections from untreated patients. Nuclear changes in the giants cells were characterized by the formation of dense chromatin material scattered throughout the nucleus. The TUNEL labeling assay indicated that the mean pretreatment apoptotic index of 7.8% increased to 53% following pamidronate treatment.

In the mouse excisional wound model, Acticoat\u2122 and Contreet\u00ae Foam indicated a strong inhibition of wound reepithelialization on the postwounding-day 7. These findings may, in part, explain the clinical observations of delayed wound healing or inhibition of wound epithelialization after the use of certain topical silver dressings. Caution should be exercised in using silver-based dressings in clean superficial wounds such as donor sites and superficial burns and also when cultured cells are being applied to wounds. \u00a9 2007 by the Wound Healing Society.", "pid": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e15089363"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Lung Fung Tse", "org": "Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology", "id": "5b5433e3e1cd8e4e15f40a15"}, {"name": "Kwok Chuen Wong", "org": "Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151a1e08"}, {"name": "Shekhar Madhukar Kumta", "org": "Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1507814a"}, {"name": "Lin Huang", "org": "Department of Surgery", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fdcb5d"}, {"name": "Tsun Cheung Chow", "org": "Department of Anatomical and Cellular Pathology", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1505e242"}, {"name": "James Francis Griffith", "org": "Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151e9ec3"}], "title": "Bisphosphonates reduce local recurrence in extremity giant cell tumor of bone: A case-control study", "keywords": ["Adjuvant therapy", "Bisphosphonates", "Giant cell tumor of bone", "Local recurrence", "Osteolytic lesions"], "venue": "Bone", "year": 2008, "abstract": "Background: Giant cell tumor (GCT) of bone is a benign but locally aggressive tumor that is characterized by the presence of mononuclear stromal cells and multinucleated giant cells. Although topical adjuvants have been used in the past, local recurrence following intralesional excision of GCT of bone continues to remain a problem. The use of bisphosphonates as an anti-osteoclastic agent in the management of osteolytic bone metastases is well accepted. Furthermore in vitro studies have shown that bisphosphonates also induce apoptosis in GCT stromal cells. Therefore our clinical study aims to investigate whether the administration of bisphosphonate as an adjuvant can further decrease local recurrence following the surgical treatment of GCT of bone. Method: A retrospective case-control study was performed between 1988 and 2004. Forty-four patients with histological diagnosed appendicular GCT were included. Intralesional curettage or wide excision of the lesions was followed with cementation or biological reconstruction. Additional intravenous and oral bisphosphonates were given peri-operatively to 24 patients who were treated between 1998 and 2004. The average follow-up of the control group was 115\u00a0months while that of the treatment group was 48\u00a0months. Results: In the bisphosphonate treated group, 1 of 24 patients (4.2%) developed local recurrence. In the control group, 6 of 20 patients (30%) developed local recurrence. The difference in the recurrence rate was statistically significant between the bisphosphonate treatment group and the control group (Log Rank test p = 0.056). The effect of reduction of local recurrence was significant in patients with stage III diseases. Patients treated with bisphosphonate did not report any untoward effects. Conclusion: Clinical use of bisphosphonates as an adjuvant therapy for giant cell tumor of bone demonstrated a lower local recurrence rate. The clinical response seems to be more promising in stage III diseases. \u00a9 2007 Elsevier Inc.

In particular, when functional interconnects such as network-on-chip (NoC) are reused as TAMs, even if they have passed manufacturing test beforehand, failures caused by electrical noise such as crosstalk and transient errors may happen during test data transfer and make good chips appear to be defective, thus leading to undesired test yield loss.

Expression of the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) in the stromal cells stimulates the monocytes to form giant multi-nucleated osteoclast-like cells, causing bone over-resorption at the tumor site. Previously, our group has reported the up-regulation of RANKL in GCT of bone stromal cells, but the mechanism is unknown. Using stromal cell culture of GCT obtained from patients, we demonstrated the up-regulation of the transcriptional activator CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBP\u03b2). RANKL promoter studies revealed that C/EBPb over-expression induced RANKL promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner and a CCAAT-box within the region nt -357/-1 contributed to the basal transcription activity, with a possible C/EBP\u03b2 binding element in the region nt -460/-358 leading to further induction. Furthermore, we also showed that C/EBP\u03b2 bound to the RANKL promoter in GCT stromal cells in vivo by chromatin immunoprecipitation. To conclude, our study has shown that C/EBP\u03b2 is a RANKL promoter activator in stromal cells of GCT of bone and we have proposed a model in which C/EBPb plays an important role in the osteolytic characteristics and pathological causes of GCT of bone. \u00a9 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.", "pid": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e15062529"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Lin Huang", "org": "Cuhk Reliable Computing Laboratory (CURE)", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fdcb5d"}, {"name": "Qiang Xu", "org": "CAS-CUHK Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Integration Technology", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150ff086"}], "title": "Energy-efficient task allocation and scheduling for multi-mode MPSoCs under lifetime reliability constraint", "venue": "Proceedings -Design, Automation and Test in Europe, DATE", "year": 2010, "abstract": "In this paper, we consider energy minimization for multiprocessor system-on-a-chip (MPSoC) under lifetime reliability constraint of the system, which has become a serious concern for the industry with technology scaling.

How to characterize the lifetime reliability of manycore processors with different usages is therefore an important and relevant problem. In this paper, we propose a novel analytical method to tackle the above problem, which captures the impact of workloads and the associated temperature variations. We then use the proposed model to analyze the lifetime reliability for manycore processors with various redundancy configurations. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated with extensive experiments. \u00a9 2010 IEEE.", "pid": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fdc79b"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Lin Huang", "org": "Division of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fdcb5d"}, {"name": "Yim-Ping Wong", "org": "Division of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1501dfac"}, {"name": "Hua Gu", "org": "Division of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1516dce2"}, {"name": "Yi-Jun Cai", "org": "Division of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e15090c9d"}, {"name": "Yeung Ho", "org": "Division of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fd9eda"}, {"name": "Chi-Chiu Wang", "org": "Li Ka Shing Institute of Health Sciences", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151a9033"}, {"name": "Tak-Yeung Leung", "org": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150ed842"}, {"name": "Andrew Burd", "org": "Division of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fb37b2"}], "title": "Stem cell-like properties of human umbilical cord lining epithelial cells and the potential for epidermal reconstitution", "keywords": ["Epidermal reconstitution", "Human umbilical cord", "Stem cells"], "venue": "Cytotherapy", "year": 2011, "abstract": "Background aims. Stem cells are particularly attractive for many cell-based therapeutic interventions because of their ability to self-renew and their capacity to differentiate into site-specific differentiating cells. Restoration of the integrity of epithelial continuity is an essential aspect of wound repair and tissue regeneration. We are currently looking at the potential of human umbilical cord lining cells as a source of epithelial stem cells with appropriate differentiation capacity for potential epidermal reconstitution. Methods. We isolated human umbilical cord lining epithelial cells (CLEC) and characterized their phenotype from the perspective of proliferative potential, telomere length, expression of epidermal differentiation markers, as well as stem cell-specific markers, and clonogenicity. Their potential for epidermal reconstitution was investigated in an organotypic culture model. Results. The results demonstrated that CLEC present a long telomere length and have a relatively high proliferative potential and passaging ability in culture. CLEC display some of the stem cell-specific markers for epithelial as well as pluripotent stem cells, including CK19, p63, OCT-4, SSEA-4, TRA-160, SOX2 and Nanog. CLEC are capable of generating a fully stratified epithelium in organotypic culture. Conclusions. The potential of CLEC to be used in clinical applications for specialized epithelial reconstruction is still unexplored. The demonstration that CLEC have stem cell-like properties and are capable of generating fully stratified epithelium provides support for their potential clinical application in epidermal reconstitution. \u00a9 2011 Informa Healthcare.", "pid": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1515c588"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Andrew Burd", "org": "Department of Surgery", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fb37b2"}, {"name": "T.

Our project aimed to study the effects of pamidronate (PAM), farnesyl transferase inhibitor (FTI-277), geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor (GGTI-298), and their combinations on GCT stromal cells (SC). Individual treatment with PAM, FTI-277, and GGTI-298, inhibited the cell viability and proliferation of GCT SC in a dose-dependent way. Combination of FTI-277 with GGTI-298 caused synergistic effects in reducing cell viability, and its combination index was 0.49, indicating a strong synergism. Moreover, the combination of FTI-277 with GGTI-298 synergistically enhanced cell apoptosis and activated caspase-3/7, -8, and -9 activities. PAM induced cell-cycle arrest at the S-phase. The combination of PAM with GGTI-298 significantly increased OPG/RANKL mRNA ratio and activated caspase-3/7 activity.

The skin has two layers, epidermis and dermis. The epidermis is rich in cells that are specialized in the formation of keratin and are called keratinocytes. The epidermis consists of a stratified layer of cells stretching from the basement membrane below to the stratum corneum above. The area of the basement membrane far exceeds that of the surface of the stratum corneum because multiple dermal papillae project from the surface of the dermis and only about 12% of the basal cells are proliferating at any one time in normal skin. These papillae are formed by loose approximations of collagen bundles referred to as the papillary dermis, which lies on the relatively much thicker reticular dermis. Collagen bundles in the reticular dermis are thicker and more condensed. The dermis consists of an organized structure of elastin and collagen fibers between which is a thick, viscous fluid made up of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and hyaluronan (HA). This arrangement of the dermis gives the skin its major biomechanical properties, allowing stretching and recoil and deformation without destruction. The dermis contains a complex vascular arrangement of capillary and venous plexuses. Within the dermis are adnexal structures of ectodermal origin-hair follicles, sweat glands, and sebaceous glands-which are lined with keratinocytes. This arrangement becomes particularly important when considering the mechanisms of wound healing. \u00a9 2008 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.", "pid": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1503f7df"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Jiaping Zhang", "org": "Institute of Burn Research", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f62f9e"}, {"name": "Jianda Dong", "org": "Key Laboratory of Reproduction and Genetic of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f50061"}, {"name": "Hua Gu", "org": "Department of Dermatology", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1516dce2"}, {"name": "Sidney Yu", "org": "Epithelial Cell Biology Research Center", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1518c729"}, {"name": "Xiaohu Zhang", "org": "Epithelial Cell Biology Research Center", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150bc791"}, {"name": "Yulin Gou", "org": "Epithelial Cell Biology Research Center", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151f07c4"}, {"name": "Wenming Xu", "org": "Epithelial Cell Biology Research Center", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1509c566"}, {"name": "Andrew Burd", "org": "Department of Surgery", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fb37b2"}, {"name": "Lin Huang", "org": "Department of Surgery", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fdcb5d"}, {"name": "Kenji Miyado", "org": "Department of Reproductive Biology and Pathology", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f755aa"}, {"name": "Yuesheng Huang", "org": "Institute of Burn Research", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e15134879"}, {"name": "Hsiao Chang Chan", "org": "Epithelial Cell Biology Research Center", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151b9087"}], "title": "CD9 is critical for cutaneous wound healing through JNK signaling", "venue": "Journal of Investigative Dermatology", "year": 2012, "abstract": "Cutaneous injury triggers a cascade of signaling events essential for wound re-epithelialization. CD9, a cell-surface protein, has been implicated in a number of cellular processes by coupling to intracellular signaling; however, its exact role in wound healing remains unidentified. We reported that CD9 was downregulated in migrating epidermis, and reelevated to basal level when re-epithelialization was completed. Although low level of CD9 appears to be required for normal wound healing, a significant healing delay was found in CD9-null mice, with wounds gaping wider on day 5 and day 7 post wounding. Further analysis showed that re-epithelialization was adversely affected in CD9-null mice, due to impaired migration of epidermis. Notably, CD9 deficiency caused a persistent enhancement of C-JUN NH2 terminal kinase (JNK) signaling primarily in migrating epidermis with abnormal elevation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 detected in CD9-null wounds, leading to excessive degradation of type IV collagen, and thus a defective basement membrane at the wound site. JNK suppression reduced MMP-9 production and therefore ameliorated the healing delay with the appearance of significantly elongated migrating epidermis in CD9-null mice. Our study demonstrated the importance of CD9 in wound re-epithelialization, linking this molecule directly to basement membrane formation and epidermal migration through participating in the regulation of the JNK/MMP-9 pathway. \u00a9 2012 The Society for Investigative Dermatology.", "pid": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e151232b4"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Andrew Burd", "org": "Department of Surgery", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fb37b2"}, {"name": "Lin Huang", "org": "Department of Surgery", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fdcb5d"}], "title": "An update review of stem cell applications in burns and wound care", "keywords": ["Burns", "stem cell", "wound"], "venue": "Indian Journal of Plastic Surgery", "year": 2012, "abstract": "The ultimate goal of the treatment of cutaneous burns and wounds is to restore the damaged skin both structurally and functionally to its original state.

The management of conditions such as giant naevi, extensive scarring and epidermolysis bullosa challenge medical professionals and lead to new and novel treatments to be developed.

The oncogenesis of GCT and factors driving the neoplastic stromal cells to proliferate extensively and pause at an early differentiation stage of pre-osteoblast lineage remain unknown. Overexpression of p63 was observed in GCTSCs and there is growing evidence that p63 is involved in oncogenesis through different mechanisms. This study aimed to understand the specific role of p63 in cell proliferation and oncogenesis of GCTSCs. We confirmed p63 expression in the mononuclear cells in GCT by immunohistochemical staining. By real-time PCR analysis, we showed a higher level (>15-fold) of TAp63 expression in GCTSCs compared to that in mesenchymal stem cells. Furthermore, we observed that knockdown of the p63 gene by siRNA transfection greatly reduced cell proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest at S phase in GCTSCs. We found that the mRNA expression of CDC2 and CDC25C was substantially suppressed by p63 knockdown at 24-72 h. Moreover, p63 was found to be recruited on the regulatory regions of CDC2 and CDC25C, which contain p53-responsive elements. In summary, our data suggest that p63 regulates GCTSC proliferation by binding to the CDC2 and CDC25C p53-REs, which may inhibit the p53 tumor suppressor activity and contribute to GCT tumorigenesis.", "pid": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e151423a2"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Lin Huang", "org": "Department of Surgery", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fdcb5d"}, {"name": "Yi J.

Results Triamcinolone suppressed cell proliferation and induced G1 cell-cycle arrest but not apoptosis. By contrast, 5-fluorouracil induced G2 cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis that may be associated with p53 activation and p21 up-regulation. The modulation of Col-1, VEGF, TGF-beta1 and MMP-2 expression by triamcinolone and 5-fluorouracil alone or their combination varied between individual cell lines; the trend is to promote a reduction in Col-1 and TGF-beta1 but up-regulation of MMP-2 expression. 5-Fluorouracil played a predominant role in the combined treatment leading to more significant cell proliferation inhibition, apoptosis, Col-1 suppression and MMP-2 induction (p < 0.05). Conclusions Our data provide the molecular-based evidence for the observed clinical benefits of adding 5-fluorouracil to a steroid injection for improved scar regression and reduced recurrence of keloids.

They have different mechanisms of action but both have been shown to delay the onset of skeletal-related events in patients with giant cell tumor of bone (GCT). However, the anti-tumor mechanisms of denosumab on the neoplastic GCT stromal cells remain unknown. In this study, we focused on the direct effects of denosumab on the neoplastic GCT stromal cells and compared with ZOL. The microscopic view demonstrated a reduced cell growth in ZOL-treated but not in denosumab-treated GCT stromal cells. ZOL was found to exhibit a dose-dependent inhibition in cell growth in all GCT stromal cell lines tested and cause apoptosis in two out of three cell lines. In contrast, denosumab only exerted a minimal inhibitory effect in one cell line and did not induce any apoptosis. ZOL significantly inhibited the mRNA expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) in two GCT stromal cell lines whereas their protein levels remained unchanged. On the contrary, denosumab did not regulate RANKL and OPG expression at both mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, the protein expression of Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor (M-CSF), Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP), and Collagen \u03b11 Type I were not regulated by denosumab and ZOL either. Our findings provide new insights in the anti-tumor effect of denosumab on GCT stromal cells and raise a concern that tumor recurrence may occur after the withdrawal of the drug. \u00a9 2013 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.", "pid": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15128eee"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Yayi He", "org": "Department of Endocrinology", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150ba65e"}, {"name": "Selina L.Y.

Fifteen diabetic rats were given MIRE intervention on their skin wounds located on the dorsum and compared with 15 control diabetic rats. Assessments were conducted for each group at weeks 1, 2 and 4 post wounding (five rats at each time point) by calculating the percentage of wound closures (WCs) and performing histological and immunohistochemical staining on sections of wound tissue. Evaluations of WCs and histological examinations of reepithelialisation, cellular content and granulation tissue formation showed no significant difference between the MIRE and the control group at each time point. Through semi-quantitative immunohistochemical staining, the deposition of type I collagen in the MIRE group was found to have improved when compared with the control group at the end of week 2 (P = 0.05). No significant differences in the myofibroblast population were detected between the two groups. In conclusion, MIRE appeared to promote collagen deposition in the early stage of wound healing in diabetic rats, but the overall wound healing in the MIRE group was not significantly different from that of the control group. \u00a9 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and Medicalhelplines.com Inc.", "pid": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151bc887"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Gladys Lai-Ying Cheing", "org": "Department of Rehabilitation Sciences", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150bd8e4"}, {"name": "Xiaohui Li", "org": "Department of Endocrinology", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1501c358"}, {"name": "Lin Huang", "org": "Department of Surgery, Division of Plastic", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fdcb5d"}, {"name": "Rachel Lai-Chu Kwan", "org": "Department of Rehabilitation Sciences", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e1520bde9"}, {"name": "Kwok-Kuen Cheung", "org": "Department of Rehabilitation Sciences", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151a4f10"}], "title": "Pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF) promote early wound healing and myofibroblast proliferation in diabetic rats", "keywords": ["Collagen", "Diabetes", "Epithelialization", "PEMF", "Pulsed electromagnetic fields", "Tensile strength", "Wound closure"], "venue": "Bioelectromagnetics", "year": 2014, "abstract": "Reduced collagen deposition possibly leads to slow recovery of tensile strength in the healing process of diabetic cutaneous wounds. Myofibroblasts are transiently present during wound healing and play a key role in wound closure and collagen synthesis. Pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF) have been shown to enhance the tensile strength of diabetic wounds. In this study, we examined the effect of PEMF on wound closure and the presence of myofibroblasts in Sprague-Dawley rats after diabetic induction using streptozotocin. A full-thickness square-shaped dermal wound (2cm\u00d72cm) was excised aseptically on the shaved dorsum. The rats were randomly divided into PEMF-treated (5mT, 25Hz, 1h daily) and control groups. The results indicated that there were no significant differences between the groups in blood glucose level and body weight. However, PEMF treatment significantly enhanced wound closure (days 10 and 14 post-wounding) and re-epithelialization (day 10 post-wounding), although these improvements were no longer observed at later stages of the wound healing process. Using immunohistochemistry against \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), we demonstrated that significantly more myofibroblasts were detected on days 7 and 10 post-wounding in the PEMF group when compared to the control group. We hypothesized that PEMF would increase the myofibroblast population, contributing to wound closure during diabetic wound healing. \u00a9 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "pid": "5b5433e3e1cd8e4e15f43d58"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Yi-Jun Cai", "org": "Division of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery, Department of Surgery, The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e15090c9d"}, {"name": "Lin Huang", "org": "Division of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery, Department of Surgery, The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fdcb5d"}, {"name": "Tak-Yeung Leung", "org": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Prince of Wales Hospital, The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150ed842"}, {"name": "Andrew Burd", "org": "Division of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery, Department of Surgery, The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fb37b2"}], "title": "A study of the immune properties of human umbilical cord lining epithelial cells", "keywords": ["Cell therapy", "Immune property", "Umbilical cord epithelial cells", "Wound healing"], "venue": "Cytotherapy", "year": 2014, "abstract": "Background aims: Our previous study has demonstrated the stem cell-like properties of human umbilical cord lining epithelial cells (CLECs) and their capability for epidermal reconstitution in organotypic skin culture; however, the immunogenicity of these cells has not been clearly defined. We assessed several aspects of the immune properties of CLECs in vitro. Methods: We examined CLECs for their immunoregulatory function in a mixed lymphocyte culture experiment. Wecharacterized the expression patterns of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), co-stimulatory molecules and the pro-/anti-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors in CLECs by means of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, flow cytometry and FlowCytomix multiple analyte detection assays. Results: CLECs were found not to induce but to suppress the proliferation response of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells in a mixed lymphocyte culture assay. They did not express the MHC class II antigen HLA-DR but the non-classic MHC class I antigens HLA-G and HLA-E and lacked the expression of the co-stimulatory molecules CD40, CD80 and CD86. In addition, they produced less interleukin-1\u03b2 and transforming growth factor-\u03b21 but more interleukin-4 and hepatocyte growth factor than did adult keratinocytes, a pattern in favor of wound healing with less inflammation response. Conclusions: Our data suggest that CLECshave an immunosuppressive function in addition to their low immunogenicity. This could be at least partially explained bytheir expression of HLA-G and HLA-E molecules associated with immune tolerance and absence of HLA-DR and co-stimulatory molecules. The demonstration that CLECs produce a favorable pattern of cytokines and growth factors for wound healing provides further support for their potential clinical application in allogeneic cell therapy. \u00a9 2014 International Society for Cellular Therapy.", "pid": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fbe626"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Lixin Yang", "org": "Kunming College of Life Science, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fb6fa0"}, {"name": "Rui Zhang", "org": "Department of Genetics, Stanford University", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e15056711"}, {"name": "Ming Li", "org": "Kunming College of Life Science, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f79b90"}, {"name": "Xujun Wu", "org": "Kunming College of Life Science, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151d589c"}, {"name": "Jianhong Wang", "org": "Laboratory of Primate Neuroscience, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e15135119"}, {"name": "Lin Huang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Genetic Resources and Evolution, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fdcb5d"}, {"name": "Xiaodong Shi", "org": "Department of Biochemistry, Qujing Normal University", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151a9243"}, {"name": "Qingwei Li", "org": "College of Life Science, Liaoning Normal University", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151a19f7"}, {"name": "Bing Su", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Genetic Resources and Evolution, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f9f9ff"}], "title": "A functional MiR-124 binding-site polymorphism in IQGAP1 affects human cognitive performance", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "year": 2014, "abstract": "As a product of the unique evolution of the human brain, human cognitive performance is largely a collection of heritable traits. Rather surprisingly, to date there have been no reported cases to highlight genes that underwent adaptive evolution in humans and which carry polymorphisms that have a marked effect on cognitive performance. IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 1 (IQGAP1), a scaffold protein, affects learning and memory in a dose-dependent manner. Its expression is regulated by miR-124 through the binding sites in the 39UTR, where a SNP (rs1042538) exists in the core-binding motif. Here we showed that this SNP can influence the miR-target interaction both in vitro and in vivo. Individuals carrying the derived T alleles have higher IQGAP1 expression in the brain as compared to the ancestral A allele carriers. We observed a significant and male-specific association between rs1042538 and tactile performances in two independent cohorts. Males with the derived allele displayed higher tactual performances as compared to those with the ancestral allele. Furthermore, we found a highly diverged allele-frequency distribution of rs1042538 among world human populations, likely caused by natural selection and/or recent population expansion. These results suggest that current human populations still carry sequence variations that affect cognitive performances and that these genetic variants may likely have been subject to comparatively recent natural selection.", "pid": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1513b432"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Zixi Kang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Inorganic Synthesis and Preparative Chemistry, Jilin University", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1507d78f"}, {"name": "Ming Xue", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Inorganic Synthesis and Preparative Chemistry, Jilin University", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151b55bf"}, {"name": "Lili Fan", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Inorganic Synthesis and Preparative Chemistry, Jilin University", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e152039be"}, {"name": "Lin Huang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Inorganic Synthesis and Preparative Chemistry, Jilin University", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fdcb5d"}, {"name": "Lijia Guo", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Inorganic Synthesis and Preparative Chemistry, Jilin University", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151f5315"}, {"name": "Guoying Wei", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Inorganic Synthesis and Preparative Chemistry, Jilin University", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1516aca4"}, {"name": "Banglin Chen", "org": "Department of Chemistry, University of Texas at San Antonio One UTSA Circle", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e151fd198"}, {"name": "Shilun Qiu", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Inorganic Synthesis and Preparative Chemistry, Jilin University", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1509b5dc"}], "title": "Highly selective sieving of small gas molecules by using an ultra-microporous metal-organic framework membrane", "venue": "Energy and Environmental Science", "year": 2014, "abstract": "Two tailor-made microporous metal-organic framework (MOF) membranes were successfully fabricated on nickel screens by secondary growth.

Consequently, the signal intensity, detection limit, and tolerance of the analytes to contaminants on the three adhesive-coated plates are improved. In the two strategies of on-plate desalting and concentration of the peptide mixture, all three adhesives reduced the loss of peptides, especially in the case of larger molecular mass peptides. The microscope and stereomicroscope images of the deposited droplets showed that after dropping onto the adhesive coats, the droplets formed a reduced spot size, were more homogeneous, and showed sticky crystallization.

We showed that adding GTP simultaneously with and prior to the esterified \u03c9G in a substrate strongly accelerated the second reaction, suggesting that the early binding of GTP facilitates the subsequent binding of \u03c9G.

I-TnaI specifically binds to and induces tertiary packing of the P4-P6 domain of the intron; this RNA-protein complex might serve as a thermostable platform for active folding of the entire intron.

The crystal structure of the C-terminal DNA-binding domain of ParB at 1.4 resolution reveals a dimeric ribbon-helix-helix (RHH) motif, supporting the prevalence of RHH motif in centromere binding. Using hydroxyl radical footprinting and quantitative binding assays, we show that the centromere core comprises nine uninterrupted 9-nt direct repeats that can be successively bound by ParB dimers in a cooperative manner. However, the interaction of ParB with a single subsite requires 18 base pairs covering one immediate repeat as well as two halves of flanking repeats. Through mutagenesis, sequence specificity was determined for each position of an 18-bp subsite.

The experimental results indicated that apoPPF could be completely disassociated into 24 free subunits at pH 13.0, and then these subunits could be quickly reassembled into the original apoPPF once the pH of the reactive medium was returned to pH7.0. This novel and simple method could be used to effectively construct a novel nanometer cisplatin core-PPF (NCC-PPF). The major characteristics of NCC-PPF were investigated using various analytical methods such as ultraviolet-spectrometry, circular dichroism spectrometry and TEM, which indicated that its molecular structure was still similar to that of the original apoPPF. Results from the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) method showed that 11.26 cisplatin (CDDP) molecules were successfully packaged within the NCC-PPF shell, indicating that each molecule of apoPPF had the ability to enwrap 11.26 CDDP molecules for constructing the NCC-PPF. Flow cytometry showed that NCC-PPF also had the ability to release CDDP for inducing the apoptosis of gastric cancer cells BGC823 (GCC), but this phenomenon could scarcely be observed using apoPPF. A differential proteomic technique using two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) gels selected and identified the differential proteins from cell apoptosis in order to reveal the molecular pathway of GCC apoptosis by both NCC-PPF and free CDDP, giving 13 differential expression proteins. These differential proteins could be further classified into six groups, which were described as being involved in the regulation of apoptosis, RNA transcription, oxidative stress response, signal transduction, cell metabolism, and cytoskeleton changes. In addition, a real-time PCR method was used to prove the expression level of mRNA and to identify the reliability of the protein expression according to these differential proteins, which indicated that the mRNA level changes of six differential proteins corresponded to those of its differential protein expression in 2-DE gels. These studies played an important role in reasonably revealing the different pathways of GCC apoptosis induced with both the CDDP released by NCC-PPF and the free CDDP. We thus suggest that apoPPF has great potential for constructing a nanometer carrier filled with various drugs for application in clinical work. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.", "pid": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1509e188"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Bo Zhu", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fcaf3d"}, {"name": "Lin Huang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151d7947"}, {"name": "He-Qing Huang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Marine Environmental Science", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fd17a5"}], "title": "Cloning analysis of ferritin and the cisplatin-subunit for cancer cell apoptosis in Aplysia juliana hepatopancreas", "keywords": ["AjFer", "Aplysia", "Biomarker", "CDDP-rAjFer", "Flow cytometry"], "venue": "Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology - C Toxicology and Pharmacology", "year": 2012, "abstract": "Ferritin, an iron storage protein, plays a key role in iron metabolism in vivo.

Objective: To observe the influence of anesthetic drugs and the controlled hypotension on cortical somatosensory evoked potential (CSEP), spinal somatosensory evoked potential(SSEP) and motor evoked potential (MEP) during the operation, and investigate their effect and influencing factors on those evoked potential. Design: A controlled pre- and post-comparison study. Setting: Department of Orthopaedics and Department of Anesthesiology, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University of Medical Sciences. Participants: The experiment was conducted in Lin-bai-xin Medical Research Center, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University of Medical Sciences. Ten healthy macaques bought from Guangzhou Zoo, in either gender, with a mean body mass of 4.3 kg(3.8 - 5.8 kg) were selected in the experiment, and anesthetized to mimic the procedures of spinal surgery monitored by CSEP, SSEP and MEP. Interventions: The CSEP, SSEP, MEP of the 10 macaques were measured and baseline was retained for contrast. The procedures of spinal surgery, anesthesia and controlled hypotension were performed in the animals. Propofol(2 mg/kg), fentanyl(4 \u03bcg/kg), Ketamine(6 mg/kg), nitro-prusside-Na and isoflurane[1.5 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC)] were applied in turn, after the wave go back to standard, the change of CSEP, SSEP, MEP of each administration were observed. Eventually controlled hypotension was applied to observe the change of figure. Main outcome measures: Changes of CSEP, SSEP and MEP after administration. Results: The influence of ketamine on CSEP latency phase was the most significant, its latency was increased by 3 - 5 ms, while the influence of isoflurane on wave amplitude was the most significant, it were decreased by 50% - 100%.

Results: According to the intention-to-treat analysis, 81 patients were all involved in the result analysis. 1 Incidence of lower-limb DVT: Incidence of DVT was 4.94%(4/81) after operation. Four days after operation, 1 case was found having swelling of affect lower limb, and emboli in popliteal vein and superficial femoral vein detected with color Doppler. Twelve days after operation, 3 cases of non-symptoms were found having DVT forming, including 1 in popliteal vein and 2 in middle segment of superficial femoral vein. Among the four above-mentioned cases, there were 2 cases of femoral neck fracture of bone cement type, 1 of non-cement type femoral neck fracture, and 1 of mixed type osteoarthritis.

Forty female New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into four groups: the mild, moderate and severe injury groups, and the control (sham operation) group. Contusion of the spinal cord was induced using a weight-drop impactor. All animals were imaged using T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequences at 30 minutes, 6 hours, and 24 hours after injury. One animal from each group was killed at each time point for histologic examination of the spinal cord. DWI had a sensitivity of 100% at all time points, whereas T2-weighted MRI had a sensitivity of 43.33% at 30 minutes after injury, 81.48% at 6 hours after injury, and 95.83% at 24 hours after injury. Conversely, the specificity of DWI was lower than that of T2-weighted MRI at all time points. One animal in the control group had a non-specific high signal on DWI. Significant systematic differences were seen between DWI and T2-weighted MRI at both 30 minutes and 6 hours after injury. The apparent diffusion coefficient values of the lesion were lower than those of adjacent unaffected regions in the mild and moderate injury groups, but higher than adjacent unaffected regions in the severe injury group. The histological findings were reliably correlated with the magnetic resonance findings. We found that DWI has a higher sensitivity, but a lower specificity, than conventional MRI for the detection of early pathological changes after contusive injury. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The distribution of EGFP and the interactions between SF and EGFP were investigated by Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy, FTIP, Raman and NMR spectroscopy. The results showed that spherical microspheres with narrow size distribution, glossy and dense surface were successfully manufactured by using UPPS technology and over 95% of EGFP encapsulation efficiency and uniform drug distribution in the microspheres were achieved.

Methods: Carbamazepine (CBZ)-nicotinamide (NIC) cocrystal solid dispersions were prepared with polymer carriers PVP/VA, SOLUPLUS and HPMC by MM and/or HME. The formation of cocrystal was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry and hot stage polarized optical microscopy. State of CBZ in solid dispersion was characterized by X-ray powder diffraction and optical microscopy. Interactions between CBZ, NIC and polymers were investigated by FTIR. Dissolution behaviors of solid dispersions were compared with that of pure CBZ. Results: CBZ-NIC cocrystal with melting point of 160\u00b0C was formed in polymer carriers during heating process, and the preparation temperature of amorphous CBZ solid dispersion was therefore depressed to 160\u00b0C. The dissolution rate of CBZ-NIC cocrystal solid dispersion was significantly increased. Conclusions: By in-situ forming cocrystal, chemically stable amorphous solid dispersions were prepared by MM and HME at a depressed processing temperature. This method provides an attractive opportunity for HME of heat-sensitive drugs. \u00a9 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.", "pid": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ff3105"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Lin Huang", "org": "Department of Orthopedics", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e1500e603"}, {"name": "Ting Dai", "org": "Department of Biochemistry", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ffbb67"}, {"name": "Xi Lin", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Oncology in Southern China", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151ad72c"}, {"name": "Xiaohui Zhao", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Oncology in Southern China", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1502bd98"}, {"name": "Xiuting Chen", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Oncology in Southern China", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1518bb90"}, {"name": "Chanjuan Wang", "org": "Department of Biochemistry", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1502fe7b"}, {"name": "Xinghua Li", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Oncology in Southern China", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e151fb709"}, {"name": "Huiyong Shen", "org": "Department of Orthopedics", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e150100e8"}, {"name": "Xi Wang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Oncology in Southern China", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fe42ce"}], "title": "MicroRNA-224 targets RKIP to control cell invasion and expression of metastasis genes in human breast cancer cells", "keywords": ["Breast cancer", "Metastasis", "MiR-224", "RKIP"], "venue": "Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications", "year": 2012, "abstract": "The Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) is a tumor suppressor that protects against metastasis and genomic instability. RKIP is downregulated in many types of tumors, although the mechanism for this remains unknown. MicroRNAs silence target genes via translational inhibition or target mRNA degradation, and are thus important regulators of gene expression. In the current study, we found that miR-224 expression is significantly upregulated in breast cancer cell lines, and especially in highly invasive MDA-MB-231 cells, compared to human normal breast epithelial cells. In addition, miR-224 inhibits RKIP gene expression by directly targeting its 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR). Moreover, metastasis, as assayed by Transwell migration, 3D growth in Matrigel, and wound healing, was enhanced by ectopic expression of miR-224 and inhibited by miR-224 downregulation. Promotion of metastasis in response to miR-224 downregulation was associated with derepression of the stroma-associated RKIP target genes, CXCR4, MMP1, and OPN, which are involved in breast tumor metastasis to the bone. Taken together, our data indicate that miR-224 play an important role in metastasis of human breast cancer cells to the bone by directly suppressing the RKIP tumor suppressor. \u00a9 2012.", "pid": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1516b479"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Shi-Yuan Li", "org": "Department of Orthopedics of Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e15066c92"}, {"name": "Peng Wang", "org": "Department of Orthopedics of Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1502a85d"}, {"name": "Yong Tang", "org": "Department of Orthopedics of Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e15058b7a"}, {"name": "Lin Huang", "org": "Department of Orthopedics of Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e1500e603"}, {"name": "Yan-Feng Wu", "org": "Department of Biological Technology Center of Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e1519b6b0"}, {"name": "Hui-Yong Shen", "org": "Department of Orthopedics of Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e150100e8"}], "title": "Analysis of methylprednisolone-induced inhibition on the proliferation of neural progenitor cells in vitro by gene expression profiling", "keywords": ["Methylprednisolone", "Microarray", "Neural progenitor cell", "Proliferation", "Spinal cord injury"], "venue": "Neuroscience Letters", "year": 2012, "abstract": "Recently, it has been proved that methylprednisolone has inhibition effect on the proliferation of endogenous neural progenitor cells (NPCs) after spinal cord injury (SCI).

After the cell quantitative analysis and CCK-8 assay, the microarray analysis was carried out. Genes differentially expressed between NPCs treated with and without methylprednisolone were extracted.

The results also show the flutter derivatives associated with self-excited aerodynamic forces depend on the amplitude of forced oscillation in addition to reduced velocity. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.", "pid": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e1510062a"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Wei-Guo Tang", "org": "School of Optoelectronic Information", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f67715"}, {"name": "Zhi-Yong Dai", "org": "School of Optoelectronic Information", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f94292"}, {"name": "Yong-Zhi Liu", "org": "School of Optoelectronic Information", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1510f7dd"}, {"name": "Zeng-Shou Peng", "org": "School of Optoelectronic Information", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ffb8ae"}, {"name": "Lin Huang", "org": "School of Optoelectronic Information", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151c14a4"}], "title": "Er3+/Yb3+ co-doped double-cladding fiber amplifier using gain equalization", "keywords": ["Cladding-pumping", "Double-cladding fiber amplifier", "Gain flattening", "Long-period fiber grating"], "venue": "Bandaoti Guangdian/Semiconductor Optoelectronics", "year": 2005, "abstract": "The characteristics of long-period grating (LPG) flattening filter are analyzed based on transmission formula, and the Er", "pid": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e15200590"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Lin Huang", "org": "School of Optoelectronic Information", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151c14a4"}, {"name": "Yong-Zhi Liu", "org": "School of Optoelectronic Information", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1510f7dd"}, {"name": "Zhi-Yong Dai", "org": "School of Optoelectronic Information", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f94292"}], "title": "Critical factors influencing characteristics of Q-switched fiber laser", "keywords": ["Amplified spontaneous emission", "Fiber laser", "Low numerical aperture large mode area fiber", "Q-switch", "Q-switched fiber laser"], "venue": "Bandaoti Guangdian/Semiconductor Optoelectronics", "year": 2005, "abstract": "Several factors influencing the characteristics of Q-switched fiber lasers, such as amplified spontaneous emission, Q-switch selection, pump power and rate, choices of fibers, repetition rate of acousto-optic modulator, reflective index of output coupled cavity mirror and so on, are analyzed theoretically.

In the presented work, the generation of pulse laser exploiting SBS phase conjugation in fiber was investigated theoretically and experimentally, and how the length of SBS medium affected the attribute of laser output was paid prior attention in our study. Numerical simulation was performed to study the waveform and the sequence of laser pulse. The waveform obtained by numerical computation was coincident with the curve described the relationship between reflectivity of SBS phase conjugation mirror and the time. The results show that changing Q value in resonant cavity by utilizing SBS phase conjugation is feasible. To investigate the attribute of laser output at different length of SBS medium, an all-fiber Er-doped Q-switched laser was designed, in which a 974 nm laser diode was used as pump source, Er-doped fiber (EDF) with length of 3 m was used as gain medium, a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) was used as fixed cavity mirror and standard single-mode fiber (SMF) G.652 with length of 2 m, 1.5 m and 1 m were used as SBS pool individually. At the same time, an optical spectrum analyzer (ANDO6319), a digital oscilloscope with 5 Gs/s (Tektronix TDS3052) and a optical power meter (ANDO AQ2140) were used to monitor the optical spectrum, temporal pulse shape and average power simultaneously. The high-speed photodetector designed by ourselves broadened the pulse duration by 20 times so as to reduce the damage to the apparatus caused by the high peak power of the laser pulses. When the length of SMF was 1.5 m, a train of pulse laser was generated with pulse duration of 2.6 ns, pulse period of 58.23 ns, average output power of 7.35 mW at pump power of 45 mW. Decreasing the length of SMF to 1 m, remarkable pulse laser with dual-peaks was obtained and the pulse period of it was 26.47 ns. Increasing the length of SMF to 2 m, only irregular stochastic pulsations were seen. Experiment data indicate that the length of SBS medium is vital to the formation of phase conjugation mirror. If it is too long, pulse laser can't be generated for the lack of fixed conjugation relation between Stokes lines, on the contrary, dual-peaks laser pulses occur for the change of photon lifetime in orthogonal polarized modes. Once the laser pulses are generated, the characteristics of laser pulses are only correlated with the stochastic characteristics of SBS and the pulse form maintain changelessness as the increase of the pump power. By means of these obtained experimental results, we can select proper length of SBS medium to yield perfect output pulse shapes, which enable this kind of self Q-switched fiber lasers to be more practical. In addition, enhanced stabilization of the pulsation can be achieved by modulating the pump power to be in resonance with the repetition rate.", "pid": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1517f86c"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Lin Huang", "org": "School of Optoelectronic Information", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151c14a4"}, {"name": "Yongzhi Liu", "org": "School of Optoelectronic Information", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1510f7dd"}, {"name": "Zhiyong Dai", "org": "School of Optoelectronic Information", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f94292"}, {"name": "Yu Zhao", "org": "School of Optoelectronic Information", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e151680bf"}, {"name": "Qianshu Zhang", "org": "Department of Physics and Electronic Information", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15febd88"}], "title": "Investigation of a self-Q-witched fiber laser based on the stimulated-Brillouin-scattering phase conjugation in single-mode-fibers", "keywords": ["Fiber laser", "Laser technique", "Phase conjugation", "Q-switched fiber laser", "Stimulated Brillouin scattering"], "venue": "Guangxue Xuebao/Acta Optica Sinica", "year": 2008, "abstract": "The generation of nanosecond-scale pulsed laser with stimulated-Brillouin-scattering (SBS) phase conjugation in fiber was investigated theoretically and experimentally.

We make use of the linear projection that is orthogonal to the within-class scatter of the apple images from a high-dimensional image space to a considerably low-dimensional image space. It separates the data-cases well, projecting away variations in lighting. Our approach maximizes the ratio of between-class scatter to that of within-class scatter of apple lesions, i.e., we can get maximal between-class distances and minimal within-class distances after projection. This implies that the gap between the classes becomes bigger and ensures optimal separability in the new space. Besides, we take advantage of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to project the set of apple images to a lower dimensional space in order to overcome the complication of the singular within-class scatter matrix. After that, the resulting within-class scatter becomes nonsingular and subsequently we can use standard FLDA to reduce the dimension further. Consequently, it is effortless for the computer to calculate the result. Experimental results demonstrate that Fisherapples performs better in apple lesion recognition than PCA. \u00a9 2009 SPIE.", "pid": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fb3535"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Lin Huang", "org": "School of Optoelectronic Information", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151c14a4"}, {"name": "Zhi-Yong Dai", "org": "School of Optoelectronic Information", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f94292"}, {"name": "Yong-Zhi Liu", "org": "School of Optoelectronic Information", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1510f7dd"}], "title": "Influences of pumping manners on characteristics of all-fiber acousto-optic Q-switched lasers under different pulse repetition rates", "keywords": ["Acousto-optic Q switching", "Fiber laser", "Pumping manner"], "venue": "Wuli Xuebao/Acta Physica Sinica", "year": 2009, "abstract": "The rate equations of all-fiber acousto-optic Q-switched lasers were solved under different initial boundary conditions by numerical simulation, and the distribution of upper-level population density along the doped fiber under forward pumping and backward pumping, and the relations between pulse energy, average power, pulse width, stored energy and pulse repetition rate, signal transmittance of the pump coupler, and pump power, were obtained.

This preclinical evaluation suggests that it is feasible to detect and characterize a breast tumor quantitatively with our qTAT method. \u00a9 2013 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.", "pid": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1512b9f3"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Qianshu Zhang", "org": "Dept. of Physics and Electronic Information", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15febd88"}, {"name": "Rongguo Lu", "org": "Key Laboratory of Broadband Optical Fiber Transmission and Communication Networks", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151d3819"}, {"name": "Jinkun Liao", "org": "Key Laboratory of Broadband Optical Fiber Transmission and Communication Networks", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1502b9b7"}, {"name": "Lin Huang", "org": "Key Laboratory of Broadband Optical Fiber Transmission and Communication Networks", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151c14a4"}, {"name": "Xionggui Tang", "org": "Key Laboratory of Broadband Optical Fiber Transmission and Communication Networks", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ffdebf"}, {"name": "Heping Li", "org": "Key Laboratory of Broadband Optical Fiber Transmission and Communication Networks", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fb8a05"}, {"name": "Y.

Unique advantages of PAI and TAI are their abilities to provide high resolution functional information such as hemoglobin and blood oxygenation and tissue dielectric properties relevant to physiology and pathology. These two methods, however, may have a limited detection depth and lack of endogenous contrast. An exogenous contrast agent is often needed to effectively resolve these problems. Such agents are able to greatly enhance the imaging contrast and potentially break through the imaging depth limit. Furthermore, a receptor-targeted contrast agent could trace the molecular and cellular biological processes in tissues. Thus, photoacoustic and thermoacoustic molecular imaging can be outstanding tools for early diagnosis, precise lesion localization, and molecular typing of various diseases. The agents also could be used for therapy in conjugation with drugs or in photothermal therapy, where it functions as an enhancer for the integration of diagnosis and therapy. In this article, we present a detailed review about various exogenous contrast agents for photoacoustic and thermoacoustic molecular imaging. In addition, challenges and future directions of photoacoustic and thermoacoustic molecular imaging in the field of translational medicine are also discussed.", "pid": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f676da"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Xin-You Zhu", "org": "Beijing Institute of Geology for Mineral Resources", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e151959cd"}, {"name": "Lin Huang", "org": "Beijing Institute of Geology for Mineral Resources", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1503353a"}, {"name": "Jin-Wa Wang", "org": "Beijing Institute of Geology for Mineral Resources", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1511b6a4"}, {"name": "Xiao-Guang Wu", "org": "Beijing Institute of Geology for Mineral Resources", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1503a506"}], "title": "A new idea of the ore-controlling structure in the Liqingdi lead-zinc-silver deposit, Inner Mongolia, and breakthrough in mineral exploration", "keywords": ["Exploration", "Inner Mongolia", "Lead-zinc deposit", "Ore-controlling structure", "Silver deposit"], "venue": "Geology in China", "year": 2005, "abstract": "Major advances have been made in mineral exploration in the Liqingdi lead-zinc-silver deposit, central Inner Mongolia in recent years. This deposit is an epithermal deposit related to Jurassic continental volcanism.

Previously it was considered that the ore-controlling fractures strike NE. Although large amount of exploration work had been done, only reserves of small silver deposits were obtained. Study shows that the NE-trending (basement) fractures control the ore zones, while the NW-trending fractures control orebodies. The major lead-zinc-silver orebodies occur in the NW-trending fractures and oreshoots occur near the intersection site of the NW- and NE-trending fractures. This new idea of the ore-controlling fractures leads to a new breakthrough in mineral exploration in the Liqingdi deposit and discovery of lead-zinc-silver oreshoots.

The latter was chosen as a reference because the relatively large evaporative moisture source should erase any possible oxygen isotope anomaly from the stratosphere.

The forest is a recycler of carbon dioxide and natural oxygen bar. Protection of forests, monitoring of forest growth is long-term task of environmental protection. It is very important to automatically statistic the forest coverage rate using optical remote sensing images and the computer, by which we can timely understand the status of the forest of an area, and can be freed from tedious manual statistics. Towards the problem of computational complexity of the global optimization using convexification, this paper proposes a level set segmentation method based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and applies it to forest segmentation in remote sensing images. The presented method needs not to do any convexity transformation for the energy functional of the goal, and uses MCMC sampling method with global optimization capability instead. The possible local minima occurring by using gradient descent method is also avoided. There are three major contributions in the paper. Firstly, by using MCMC sampling, the convexity of the energy functional is no longer necessary and global optimization can still be achieved. Secondly, taking advantage of the data (texture) and knowledge (a priori color) to guide the construction of Markov chain, the convergence rate of Markov chains is improved significantly. Finally, the level set segmentation method by integrating a priori color and texture for forest is proposed. The experiments show that our method can efficiently and accurately segment forest in remote sensing images.", "pid": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150a9009"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Ping Yang", "org": "Optics-Electrics Application of Biomaterials Laboratory, Jiangxi Agricultural University", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e150528d8"}, {"name": "Ming-Yin Yao", "org": "Optics-Electrics Application of Biomaterials Laboratory, Jiangxi Agricultural University", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ffd8ec"}, {"name": "Lin Huang", "org": "Optics-Electrics Application of Biomaterials Laboratory, Jiangxi Agricultural University", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f811be"}, {"name": "Hui-Qin Hu", "org": "Optics-Electrics Application of Biomaterials Laboratory, Jiangxi Agricultural University", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e1501387e"}, {"name": "Juan Chen", "org": "Optics-Electrics Application of Biomaterials Laboratory, Jiangxi Agricultural University", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fdbef6"}, {"name": "Yu-Yu Zhang", "org": "Optics-Electrics Application of Biomaterials Laboratory, Jiangxi Agricultural University", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f490eb"}, {"name": "Shu-Feng Hu", "org": "Optics-Electrics Application of Biomaterials Laboratory, Jiangxi Agricultural University", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151cb539"}, {"name": "Cai-Hong Wang", "org": "Optics-Electrics Application of Biomaterials Laboratory, Jiangxi Agricultural University", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f86685"}, {"name": "Mu-Hua Liu", "org": "Optics-Electrics Application of Biomaterials Laboratory, Jiangxi Agricultural University", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fe181c"}], "title": "Detection of Pb in potato by LIBS and the partial least square quantity analysis model", "keywords": ["Agricultural product", "Heavy metal", "Laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS)", "Partial least squares (PLS)", "Rapid detection"], "venue": "Guangdianzi Jiguang/Journal of Optoelectronics Laser", "year": 2015, "abstract": "Lower detection accuracy restricts the development of laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS).

Spectral data of the 96 potatoes samples are pretreated by different data smoothing from 3 points to 17 points.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the association between the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 45T/G and plasma adiponectin levels and the prevalence of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Uygurs of the Xinjiang region, China. 2. We performed a cross-sectional survey in a representative sample of 151 Uygur adults aged 24-80 years. The polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method was used to determine the distribution of allele and genotype frequency of the SNP45 T/G polymorphism (exon 2) in the adiponectin gene. An ELISA was used to determine plasma adiponectin levels. Logistic regression was used to screen risk factors for T2DM. 3. Compared with the normal glucose tolerance (NGT) group, the T2DM group exhibited a higher distribution of the TG + GG genotype, G allele frequency and lower plasma adiponectin concentrations in TG + GG genotype carriers compared with those with the TT genotype. Compared with SNP45 T carriers, in the NGT group, G carriers had higher levels of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, low density lipoprotein (P < 0.05) and total cholesterol (P < 0.005). In the T2DM group, G carriers had lower levels of homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) of insulin sensitivity (P < 0.05) and higher levels of HOMA of insulin resistance (P < 0.05). 4. Adiponectin SNP 45 is positively correlated with the prevalence of T2DM in Uygurs of Xinjiang. The G allele carriers who have reduced plasma concentrations of adiponectin may have associated insulin resistance. \u00a9 2007 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.", "pid": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151c001f"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Rongjie Yu", "org": "Engineering Institute", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150dda71"}, {"name": "Jingjing Wang", "org": "Engineering Institute", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f4e48a"}, {"name": "Juan Li", "org": "Engineering Institute", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1514d17b"}, {"name": "Ye Wang", "org": "Sinoasis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150f03ee"}, {"name": "Huahua Zhang", "org": "Medical Genetics Lab", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151b36c4"}, {"name": "Jiansu Chen", "org": "Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e150994d8"}, {"name": "Lin Huang", "org": "Engineering Institute", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1518e16c"}, {"name": "Xiaofei Liu", "org": "Engineering Institute", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e150320cb"}], "title": "A novel cyclopeptide from the cyclization of PACAP(1-5) with potent activity towards PAC1 attenuates STZ-induced diabetes", "keywords": ["Agonist", "Cyclization", "PAC1", "PACAP", "STZ-induced diabetes"], "venue": "Peptides", "year": 2010, "abstract": "The N-terminal deletion of pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP)(1-5) generates its own antagonist.

Methods: VEGF-induced cell proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells was studied by MTT assay, cell migration by the gelatin modified Boyden chamber (Transwell) and angiogenesis in vitro by endothelial cell tube formation in Matrigel. Angiogenesis in vivo was determined by the Matrigel plug assay. Heterotopic tumors were established by the subcutaneously injection of SGC-7901 cells in nude mice. The tumor growth was measured by caliper in two dimensions, and tumor angiogenesis was determined with tumor microvessel density by immunohistology. Results: EGCG inhibited VEGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent manner, and VEGF-induced endothelial cell migration and tube formation were also dose-dependently inhibited by EGCG, P<0.05. In vivo neovascularization of Matrigel plug induced by VEGF was markedly inhibited by EGCG. The intraperitoneal injection of EGCG significantly inhibited the tumor growth in nude mice, and an average of 60.4% suppression of primary tumor growth was observed. The microvessel density in tumor tissues receiving EGCG treatment was also markedly reduced (P<0.01).

A transect crossing Jinggang Mountain-Jitai Basin-Yushan Mountain-Wuyi Mountain was selected as the study area. The authors integrated field data collected in two field surveys to analyze the impacts of the disturbance on forests. The following results were obtained. (1) The extent of damage to plantations along the transect decreased in the order of slash pine > masson pine > mixed plantation > Chinese fir. Slash pine is an introduced species from southern America which is characterized by fast growth, low wood quality and rich oleoresin, and showed a damage rate of 61.3% of samples, of which 70.4% cannot recover naturally. Masson pine is the native pioneer species of forests with harder wood, and 52.5% were damaged due to turpentine, of which 60.9% cannot recovery naturally. Chinese fir is a local tree species and samples showed a rate of 46% and a relative rate of 32.5%, lower than the mixed plantation. (2) From west to east along the transect, we can see that evergreen broad-leaved forest of the western transect on Jinggang Mountain showed the lightest damage extent, and a Cryptomeria plantation at an altitude of 700 m was severely destroyed while Chinese fir showed light damage below 700 m and relatively severe damage above 900 m. Masson pine and slash pine in the central transect in Jitai Basin were damaged severely due to turpentine activities, and closed natural secondary deciduous broad-leaved forest was damaged severely due to high ice and snow accumulation on intertwined shrubs. Masson pine aerial-seeding plantations below 400 m along the eastern transect in Xingguo and Ningdu counties were nearly undamaged for small tree sizes, and Chinese fir at 500-900 m altitude showed a lighter damage extent. However, masson pine which was distributed above 400 m and planted in the 1960s, was severely damaged due to turpentine. \u00a9 2011 Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.", "pid": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f6d936"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Lin Huang", "org": "The Institute of Geographical Sciences and Natural Resources Research", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150d8004"}, {"name": "Jiyuan Liu", "org": "The Institute of Geographical Sciences and Natural Resources Research", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f82c31"}, {"name": "Quanqin Shao", "org": "The Institute of Geographical Sciences and Natural Resources Research", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e151fed36"}, {"name": "Ronggao Liu", "org": "The Institute of Geographical Sciences and Natural Resources Research", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151d5acc"}], "title": "Changing inland lakes responding to climate warming in Northeastern Tibetan Plateau", "venue": "Climatic Change", "year": 2011, "abstract": "The main portion of Tibetan Plateau has experienced statistically significant warming over the past 50 years, especially in cold seasons.

The variability of net primary production (NPP) and rain use efficiency (RUE) were analyzed as indicators of vegetation productivity. Our study showed that changes in grassland cover were closely related to the relative area of farmland, with increases in grassland being caused by returning farmland to grassland and decreases being caused by reclamation for agriculture. The results of NPP and RUE measurements over the past 30 years showed systematic increases in the area of grassland in most regions, especially from 2000 to 2008. This fact was reflected by intensified vegetation activity and cannot be completely explained by the warmer and wetter climate, which suggested a contribution from restored, ungrazed grasslands.

This study presents the potential energy budget change caused by deforestation in Northeastern China and its climate implications, which was evaluated by quantifying the differences in MODIS-observed surface physical properties between cropland and forest. We used the MODIS land products for the period of 2001-2010 in 112 cells of 0.75\u00b0 \u00d7 0.75\u00b0 each, within which only best quality satellite pixels over the pure forest and cropland pixels are selected for comparison. It is estimated that cropland has a winter (summer) mean albedo of 0.38 (0.16), which is 0.15 (0.02) higher than that of forest. Due to the higher albedo, cropland absorbs 16.84 W\u00b7m<sup>-2</sup> (3.08 W\u00b7m<sup>-2</sup>) less shortwave radiation than forest. Compared to forest, cropland also absorbs 8.79 W\u00b7m<sup>-2</sup> more longwave radiation in winter and 8.12 W\u00b7m<sup>-2</sup> less longwave radiation in summer. In total, the surface net radiation of cropland is 7.53 W\u00b7m<sup>-2</sup> (11.2 W\u00b7m<sup>-2</sup>) less than that of forest in winter (summer).

The Ti-Nb-Zr-O nanostructures demonstrated a good capability of inducing apatite formation after immersion in simulated body fluids (SBFs). Drug delivery experiment based on gentamicin and the Ti-Nb-Zr-O nanostructures indicated that a high drug loading content could result in a prolonged release process and a higher quantity of drug residues in the oxide nanostructures after drug release. Quick stem cell adhesion and spreading, as well as fast formation of extracellular matrix materials on the surfaces of the Ti-Nb-Zr-O nanostructures, were found.

Some part of the trabecular meshwork was completely covered with pigment patch and trabecular structure could not be seen, the others were observed as trabecular meshwork fibrosis with hyaline degeneration. There was proliferation of endothelial cells in trabecular meshwork which caused lumen stenosis or occlusion.

Using a yeast two-hybrid screening system, we identified Rshl-2, Gstmu1, and Ddc8 as putative binding partners of the Trs4 protein in mouse testes. Their interactions were confirmed by in vivo and in vitro binding assays. Further studies demonstrated that Ddc8, a newly identified gene with unknown functions, displayed a similar expression pattern with Trs4 in mouse testes.

It has been reported that the members of Notch signaling are expressed in mammalian ovaries, but the exact functions of this pathway in follicle development is still unclear. In this study, primary follicles were cultured in vitro and treated with Notch signaling inhibitors, L-658,458 and N-[N-(3,5-Difluorophenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-S- phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT). We found that the cultured follicles completely stopped developing after L-658,458 and DAPT treatment, most of the granulosa cells were detached, and the oocytes were also degenerated with condensed cytoplasma. Further studies demonstrated that the proliferation of granulosa cells was dependent on the Notch signaling. L-658,458 and DAPT treatment inhibited proliferation of in vitro cultured primary granulosa cells and decreased the expression of c-Myc.

The results showed that depletion of MBTD1 caused reduced expression of histone lysine methyl transferase Pr-Set7 and H4K20me1 as well as increased oocyte arrest at the GV stage. Increased \u03b3H2AX foci were formed, and DNA damage repair checkpoint protein 53BP1 was downregulated.

Actin-dependent meiosis I spindle positioning to the cortex induces the formation of a polarized actin cap and oocyte polarity, and it determines asymmetric divisions resulting in two polar bodies. Here we investigate the functions of Cdc42 in oocyte meiotic maturation by oocyte-specific deletion of Cdc42 through Cre-loxP conditional knockout technology. We find that Cdc42 deletion causes female infertility in mice. Cdc42 deletion has little effect on meiotic spindle organization and migration to the cortex but inhibits polar body emission, although homologous chromosome segregation occurs. The failure of cytokinesis is due to the loss of polarized Arp2/3 accumulation and actin cap formation; thus the defective contract ring. In addition, we correlate active Cdc42 dynamics with its function during polar body emission and find a relationship between Cdc42 and polarity, as well as polar body emission, in mouse oocytes.\u00a9 2013 Shen and Osmani.

Objectives: To understand the underlying mechanisms responsible for the negative effects of maternal obesity, we investigated the DNA methylation status of several imprinted genes and metabolism-related genes. Methods: Using a high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced mouse model of obesity, we analyzed the DNA methylation of several imprinted genes and metabolism-related genes in oocytes from control and obese dams and in oocytes and liver from their offspring. Analysis was performed using combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA) and bisulfite sequencing. Results: DNA methylation of imprinted genes in oocytes was not altered in either obese dams or their offspring; however, DNA methylation of metabolism-related genes was changed. In oocytes of obese mice, the DNA methylation level of the leptin (Lep) promoter was significantly increased and that of the Ppar-\u03b1 promoter was reduced. Increased methylation of Lep and decreased methylation of Ppar-\u03b1 was also observed in the liver of female offspring from dams fed the high-fat diet (OHFD). mRNA expression of Lep and Ppar-\u03b1 was also significantly altered in the liver of these OHFD. In OHFD oocytes, the DNA methylation level of Ppar-\u03b1 promoter was increased. Conclusions: Our results indicate that DNA methylation patterns of several metabolismrelated genes are changed not only in oocytes of obese mice but also in oocytes and liver of their offspring. These data may contribute to the understanding of adverse effects of maternal obesity on reproduction and health of the offspring.", "pid": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1508d4b1"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Meng-Wen Hu", "org": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150a8537"}, {"name": "Zhen-Bo Wang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Biology, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fa5d4d"}, {"name": "Zong-Zhe Jiang", "org": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1518b270"}, {"name": "Shu-Tao Qi", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Biology, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f9f4c8"}, {"name": "Lin Huang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Biology, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f702c5"}, {"name": "Qiu-Xia Liang", "org": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e151588fc"}, {"name": "Heide Schatten", "org": "Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, University of Missouri", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e15131378"}, {"name": "Qing-Yuan Sun", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Biology, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1503eb8f"}], "title": "Scaffold subunit aalpha of PP2A is essential for female meiosis and fertility in mice", "keywords": ["conditional knockout", "meiosis", "oocyte", "PP2A", "PSSC"], "venue": "Biology of Reproduction", "year": 2014, "abstract": "Ppp2r1a encodes the scaffold subunit Aalpha of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which is an important and ubiquitously expressed serine threonine phosphatase family and plays a critical role in many fundamental cellular processes. To identify the physiological role of PP2A in female germ cell meiosis, we selectively disrupted Ppp2r1a expression in oocytes by using the Cre-Loxp conditional knockout system. Here we report for the first time that oocyte-specific deletion of Ppp2r1a led to severe female subfertility without affecting follicle survival, growth, and ovulation. PP2A-Aalpha was essential for regulating oocyte meiotic maturation because depletion of PP2A-Aalpha facilitated germinal vesicle breakdown, causing elongation of the MII spindle and precocious separation of sister chromatids. The resulting eggs had high risk of aneuploidy, though they could be fertilized, leading to defective embryonic development and thus subfertility. Our findings provide strong evidence that PP2A-Aalpha within the oocyte plays an indispensable role in oocyte meiotic maturation, though it is dispensable for folliculogenesis in the mouse ovary. \u00a9 2014 by the Society for the Study of Reproduction, Inc.", "pid": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151b52bc"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Fei Lin", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Biology, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fe4210"}, {"name": "Xue-Shan Ma", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Biology, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151f0245"}, {"name": "Zhen-Bo Wang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Biology, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fa5d4d"}, {"name": "Zhong-Wei Wang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Biology, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1513c872"}, {"name": "Yi-Bo Luo", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Biology, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151e816f"}, {"name": "Lin Huang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Biology, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f702c5"}, {"name": "Zong-Zhe Jiang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Biology, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1518b270"}, {"name": "Meng-Wen Hu", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Biology, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150a8537"}, {"name": "Heide Schatten", "org": "Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, University of Missouri", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e15131378"}, {"name": "Qing-Yuan Sun", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Biology, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1503eb8f"}], "title": "Different fates of oocytes with DNA double-strand breaks in vitro and in vivo", "keywords": ["Apoptosis", "DNA double-strand breaks", "Meiosis", "Oocyte", "Spindle assembly checkpoint"], "venue": "Cell Cycle", "year": 2014, "abstract": "In female mice, despite the presence of slight DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), fully grown oocytes are able to undergo meiosis resumption as indicated by germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD); however, severe DNA DSBs do reduce and delay entry into M phase through activation of the DNA damage checkpoint. But little is known about the effect of severe DNA DSBs on the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) during oocyte maturation. We showed that nearly no first polar body (PB1) was extruded at 12 h of in vitro maturation (IVM) in severe DNA DSBs oocytes, and the limited number of oocytes with PB1 were actually at telophase. However, about 60% of the severe DNA DSBs oocytes which underwent GVBD at 2 h of IVM released a PB1 at 18 h of IVM and these oocytes did reach the second metaphase (MII) stage. Chromosome spread at MI and MII stages showed that chromosomes fragmented after GVBD in severe DNA DSBs oocytes. The delayed PB1 extrusion was due to the disrupted attachment of microtubules to kinetochores and activation of the SAC. At the same time, misaligned chromosome fragments became obvious at the first metaphase (MI) in severe DNA DSBs oocytes. These data implied that the inactivation of SAC during the metaphase-anaphase transition of first meiosis was independent of chromosome integrity. Next, we induced DNA DSBs in vivo, and found that the number of superovulated oocytes per mouse was significantly reduced; moreover, this treatment increased the percentage of apoptotic oocytes.

Fine roots are the major organ trees use to absorb water and nutrients. They play an important and significant role in the processes of carbon allocation and nutrient cycling of forested ecosystems. Therefore, an understanding of the structure and function of root systems allows us to enhance forest ecosystem productivity and to understand the way available resources are used belowground. No single, widely accepted definition of what makes up a fine root exists, although most researchers refer to roots \u2264 2 mm in diameter as fine roots. We studied eight forest types in a hilly red soil area in South China during the 2010 growing season. We measured important root characteristics at a variety of soil depths such as the distribution of RLD (root length density) in several size (diameter) classes, fractal dimensions and the relationships between RLD and soil bulk density, and between soil organic carbon and total nitrogen. The results indicate Pinus massoniana low-benefit forest (PMLF) has the lowest RLD, but larger densities were found in Chinese fir low efficiency forest (CLF) and Pinus elliottii forest. The RLD in topsoil was significantly correlated to the shrub-herb layer coverage (r=0.793, P<0.05). RLD of all forest types decreased with the increasing of soil depth. The effects of plant species and growth conditions on RLD declined with increasing soil depth. Also, the differences of RLD among forest types gradually decreased as soil depth increased. In the different habitats, no obvious changes were found between RLD and diameter class in the same soil layer. The RLD in the 0 to \u2264 0.2 mm diameter class was the highest in Pinus massoniana Low-benefit Forest (PLF), and the RLD usually peaked in the 0.2 to \u2264 0.5 mm diameter class in all forest types except Pinus massoniana Low-benefit Forest (PLF). RLD in all diameter classes all declined as soil depth increased. As root diameter increased, the differences of RLD increased significantly in the shallowest soil layer and in the deepest soil sample. Correlation analysis indicated RLD was significantly correlated with soil organic carbon and total-N, while there was a negative correlation between RLD and soil bulk density. RLD in the 1-2 mm diameter class had a significant impact on soil structure, soil organic carbon and total-N accumulation. The fractal dimensions of root length ranged from 2.0973 to 2.6063 in all forest types. Samples with fractal dimensions had higher concentrations of roots in the 0-0.2 mm diameter length class. This suggests the succession process of the root system not only affected by plant genetic characteristics and climate factors, but it also influences soil quality; and its various characteristics were also closely related. The function of roots in improving soil structure or increasing nutrient availability would be weakened if the diameter class was too large or too small with the same root length. Therefore, ecological management and forest development should include the consideration of root characteristics. Forest stand structure, which consists of trees, shrubs and herbs, should be managed in a way which enhances ecological system functions and increases and maintains soil productivity.", "pid": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1502392e"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Ling Jiang", "org": "Department of Information Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e151241f0"}, {"name": "Chun Li", "org": "Department of Information Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f51804"}, {"name": "Lin Huang", "org": "Department Forest Resources and Environment", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e151756cd"}, {"name": "Zhenwei Zhang", "org": "Terahertz Laboratory", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fac834"}, {"name": "Cunlin Zhang", "org": "Terahertz Laboratory", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f81381"}, {"name": "Yunfei Liu", "org": "Department of Information Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151d765c"}], "title": "Investigation of terahertz spectral signatures of DNA of pine wood nematode", "keywords": ["Absorption frequency", "Bm nematode", "Bx nematode", "Terahertz spectroscopy"], "venue": "Advance Journal of Food Science and Technology", "year": 2012, "abstract": "In this study, we present the fingerprint characteristic about the identification of harmful Bursaphelenchus xylophilus (Bx) nematode and harmless Bursaphelenchus mucronatus (Bm) nematode by applying terahertz spectroscopic techniques.

Riparian plants possess various traits to survive flooding, while their sensitivity to drought has received less attention. To investigate the growth and photosynthetic responses of a riparian species (Bolboschoenus planiculmis) to flooding and drought, plants of this species were subjected to 60-d flooding or drought stress under greenhouse conditions. Growth and photosynthetic traits were measured at the end of the treatments. As well, we determined the efficiency of photosynthetic apparatus in mature leaves. Plants of B. planiculmis adequately adjusted their growth and photosynthetic traits under both flooding and drought conditions. Flooding did not affect the above-ground growth of B. planiculmis. Increased growth of roots and rhizomes and the generation of new tubers suggested a high ability of below-ground lateral growth by capturing resources under flooding conditions. Enhanced photosynthetic capacity, retained leaf pigment concentrations and chlorophyll a fluorescence capacity indicated photosynthetic adaptation to flooding. In contrast, drought significantly decreased the above-ground growth of B. planiculmis, especially the leaves, thereby minimizing water loss due to transpiration. Its increased root to shoot ratio and \"phalanx\" asexual propagation pattern might enhance soil water uptake ability. Although the functional leaves of B. planiculmis could retain their leaf pigment concentrations, as well as photosynthesis and chlorophyll a fluorescence, the total biomass of plants decreased, which may be a consequence of the reduced leaf area, suggesting adverse effects by drought. Therefore, both growth and photosynthetic responses of B. planiculmis are likely to contribute to the ability of this species to thrive in riparian regions, but remain susceptive to drought. \u00a9 2013 Beijing Forestry University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.", "pid": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e15193131"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Xiuwen Qiu", "org": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Prevention and Management of Invasive Species", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151cf26e"}, {"name": "Xiaoqin Wu", "org": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Prevention and Management of Invasive Species", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e1520a965"}, {"name": "Lin Huang", "org": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Prevention and Management of Invasive Species", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e151756cd"}, {"name": "Minqi Tian", "org": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Prevention and Management of Invasive Species", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150e2e46"}, {"name": "Jianren Ye", "org": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Prevention and Management of Invasive Species", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f7d604"}], "title": "Specifically Expressed Genes of the Nematode Bursaphelenchus Xylophilus Involved with Early Interactions with Pine Trees", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "year": 2013, "abstract": "As the causal agent of pine wilt disease (PWD), the pine wood nematode (PWN), Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, causes huge economic losses by devastating pine forests worldwide.

The microarray data confirmed the specific expression of B. xylophilus genes during infection of P. thunbergii, which provides basic information that facilitates a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of PWD. \u00a9 2013 Ye et al.", "pid": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1511064f"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Wei Xue", "org": "School of Nature Conservation", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15126395"}, {"name": "Lin Huang", "org": "School of Nature Conservation", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e151756cd"}, {"name": "Bi-Cheng Dong", "org": "School of Nature Conservation", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150de306"}, {"name": "Ming-Xiang Zhang", "org": "School of Nature Conservation", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fb36ec"}, {"name": "Fei-Hai Yu", "org": "School of Nature Conservation", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150a6e9d"}], "title": "Patchy Distributions of Competitors Affect the Growth of a Clonal Plant When the Competitor Density Is High", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "year": 2013, "abstract": "Environments are patchy in not only abiotic factors but also biotic ones. Many studies have examined effects of spatial heterogeneity in abiotic factors such as light, water and nutrients on the growth of clonal plants, but few have tested those in biotic factors. We conducted a greenhouse experiment to examine how patchy distributions of competitors affect the growth of a rhizomatous wetland plant Bolboschoenus planiculmis and whether such effects depend on the density of the competitors. We grew one ramet of B. planiculmis in the center of each of the experimental boxes without competitors (Schoenoplectus triqueter), with a homogeneous distribution of the competitors of low or high density, and with a patchy distribution of the competitors of low or high density. The presence of competitors markedly decreased the growth (biomass, number of ramets, number of tubers and rhizome length) of the B. planiculmis clones. When the density of the competitors was low, the growth of B. planiculmis did not differ significantly between the competitor patches and competitor-free patches. However, when the density of the competitors was high, the growth of B. planiculmis was significantly higher in the competitor-free patches than in the competitor patches. Therefore, B. planiculmis can respond to patchy distributions of competitors by placing more ramets in competition-free patches when the density of competitors is high, but cannot do so when the density of competitors is low. \u00a9 2013 Xue et al.", "pid": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e151661bd"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Ai-Dong Zhou", "org": "College of Forest Resources and Environment", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e1510215a"}, {"name": "Xiao-Qin Wu", "org": "College of Forest Resources and Environment", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e1520a965"}, {"name": "Lan Shen", "org": "College of Forest Resources and Environment", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15110f2e"}, {"name": "Xu-Ling Xu", "org": "College of Forest Resources and Environment", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fba688"}, {"name": "Lin Huang", "org": "College of Forest Resources and Environment", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e151756cd"}, {"name": "Jian-Ren Ye", "org": "College of Forest Resources and Environment", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f7d604"}], "title": "Profiling of differentially expressed genes in ectomycorrhizal fungus Pisolithus tinctorius responding to mycorrhiza helper Brevibacillus reuszeri MPt17", "keywords": ["Brevibacillus reuszeri", "differentially expressed genes", "mycorrhiza helper bacteria", "Pisolithus tinctorius", "suppression subtraction hybridization"], "venue": "Biologia (Poland)", "year": 2014, "abstract": "A cDNA library of the ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungus Pisolithus tinctorius Pt2 after interaction with the mycorrhiza helper bacterium (MHB) Brevibacillus reuszeri MPt17 was constructed by suppression subtraction hybridization.

Spearman correlation analysis shows an increase relation between neutrophil count and flap survival rate in the different groups (P <0.05).Conclusion: Ischemic post-conditioning has protective effect on ischemic preconditioned skin flaps, but the post-conditioning should be performed within 5 minutes after the end of ischemia. \u00a9 2013 huang et al.", "pid": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e150466bb"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Lin Huang", "org": "Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fb4bff"}], "title": "Does Sensation Return to the Nasal Tip After Microfat Grafting?", "venue": "Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery", "year": 2015, "abstract": "Purpose Patients usually complain about numbness in the nasal tip after microfat injections. The present study evaluated the severity of the numbness in the nasal tip after the procedure. Patients and Methods To address the research question, a prospective study of young women was designed and performed at the Beijing Anzhen Hospital. Time was the primary predictor variable. The nasal tip sensation, which was evaluated using objective and subjective assessments, was used as the primary outcome variable. The McNemar-Bowker test (time vs nasal tip sensation) was used to detect statistical significance. Results A total of 30 young women (age 20.04 \u00b1 3.63 years) were recruited for the present study. The preoperative mean touch threshold value was 3.60 units. One week after the injection, the women experienced a decrease in the touch threshold value by 2.50 units. However, the sensation recovered gradually during the follow-up period (1.51 units at week 2, 2.39 units at week 4, 3.01 units at week 8, and 3.35 units at week 12). Significant differences were detected between multiple different measurement points (P < .05). The percentage of those experiencing paresthesia after the microfat injections also gradually diminished to none. Conclusion Postoperative numbness occurs in most patients receiving nasal microfat injections. Partial to complete recovery of nasal tip sensation can be expected to occur over a 3-month period.", "pid": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e151f864f"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Lin Huang", "org": "Wuxi Institute of Technology", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fadb84"}, {"name": "Maolong Xi", "org": "Wuxi Institute of Technology", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f61be1"}, {"name": "Yanghua Zhou", "org": "School of Information Technology", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e151885bb"}], "title": "An improved quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization with random selection of the optimal individual", "keywords": ["QPSO", "Random selection", "Weighted parameter"], "venue": "Proceedings - 2010 WASE International Conference on Information Engineering, ICIE 2010", "year": 2010, "abstract": "The random selection of optimal individual is introduced into Quantum-behaved Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO) to increase the diversity of the swarm in the latter period of the search, and a linear weight parameter which implied the importance of particles in population according to their fitness value is used in QPSO to balance the global and local searching abilities while having better convergence speed at the same time, and proposes a revised QPSO algorithm.

So far, three alternative splicing products of human PIDD gene have been identified. Here we report a new splicing variant of this gene and named it PIDD4. The coding sequence of PIDD4 contains intron 3 and a 60. bp insert at the 5\u2032 of exon 3. Each insertion has an in-frame stop codon, which makes PIDD4 get translated from exon 5 then. Therefore, PIDD4 protein lacks the 32 KD N-terminal peptide, missing the LRR domain found in the other three isoforms. In this study, we have shown that the expression of PIDD4 is also regulated by p53, and as PIDD2, it is not expressed in heart either. Moreover, PIDD4 is the only isoform which is expressed in skeletal muscle. This isoform mainly localizes in the cytoplasm, and produces a relatively higher proportion of PIDD-CC fragment.

In the TCDP case (Taiwan Chelungpu fault Drilling Project), three fault zones of the Chelungpu-fault system were identified at the depth of 1111. m, 1153. m, and 1222. m (described as FZ1111, FZ1153, and FZ1222 hereafter), respectively. The clay mineral assemblages of FZ1111 show evidence of melting, and the temperature in a ~. 2. cm band within the black gouge zone is estimated to be from 900\u00b0C to 1100\u00b0C by comparing the SEM images of in situ natural samples with those of heated materials, and the finding of no recrystallization of kaolinite-amorphous aluminosilicates-spinel in the fault samples. The clay mineral assemblages of FZ1153 suggested that kaolinite has been broken down by the thermal decomposition/dehydroxylation but chlorite has not. The clay characteristics and results of SEM/EDX and TGA constrain the faulting temperature from 500\u00b0C to 900\u00b0C, with a spatial distribution up to ~. 1.3. m. The clay characteristics of FZ1222 indicated that clays were changed by experiencing high temperature acid fluids, instead of thermal decomposition/dehydroxylation processes, and that the temperature is localized in ~. 2. cm and ranges from 350\u00b0C to 500\u00b0C, the lowest temperature among three fault zones.

When compared with the control, dietary supplementation with L-arginine decreased (P<0.05) blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and improved (P<0.05) serum T3 and insulin level of the piglets on day 11. Arginine and its metabolites (citrulline and ornithine) were elevated, additionally, dietary supplementation with 0.8% L-arginine markedly enhanced jejunal villus height, villus area on day 11 and D-xylose absorption rate on day 19. Dietary supplementation with 0.8% L-arginine increased (P<0.05) activities of maltose and lactose on day 18, respectively. This effect correlated with profound change in enzyme activities as inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS), glutamine synthetase (GS) and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) were elevated on day 18.

The motivation and basic principles are analyzed. Implementation of Staggered Work Hours should satisfy three basic conditions: firstly, there exists obvious peak period of travel demand, second, the flow of road traffic or public transport also have significant peaks, third, during the peak period, either road traffic or public transport is very crowded. As an example, the traffic applicability of Staggered Work Hours in the City of Guangzhou is analyzed through relevant statistics and surveys. Peak period of travel demand is obvious, bus and metro are both crowded during the peak hours. But on the contrary, the variation of road flow and speed is not obvious in downtown area, traffic operation is under high load condition during daytime. Other characteristics, such as travel distance and time changes of residents, spatial distribution of traffic congestion, and the occupational structure are also considered. In the end, a conclusion is made that in the short term, Staggered Work Hours will have positive impact on public transport condition, but bring little improvement on road condition. It's suggested that measures of Staggered Work Hours can be implemented originally within a small scope of residents, and gradually adjust according to the effects. \u00a9 2011 ASCE.", "pid": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151a77b1"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Jun Li", "org": "Research Center of Intelligent Transportation System", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150e8a64"}, {"name": "Lin Huang", "org": "Research Center of Intelligent Transportation System", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1515cd40"}], "title": "Stochastic traffic assignment considering road guidance information", "keywords": ["Market penetration", "Network loading", "Road guidance information", "Stochastic traffic assignment", "Traffic engineering"], "venue": "Jiaotong Yunshu Xitong Gongcheng Yu Xinxi/Journal of Transportation Systems Engineering and Information Technology", "year": 2012, "abstract": "A Logit-based stochastic traffic assignment method considering the acceptance of traffic information is proposed to evaluate the impact of road guidance information on flow patterns.

The result demonstrates that our prediction model provides a solution to forecast public parking facilities scale. \u00a9 (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.", "pid": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150b7189"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Lin Huang", "org": "School of Graduate Shijiazhuang Tiedao University", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150fe260"}, {"name": "Shu Hai Wang", "org": "School of Continuing Education Shijiazhuang Tiedao University", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fc4be0"}, {"name": "Yu Fan", "org": "School of Graduate Shijiazhuang Tiedao University", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e1500b222"}], "title": "Design and realization of the evaluation of expert reputation in the online evaluation system for the master dissertation", "keywords": ["Master dissertation", "Online evaluation", "Reputation evaluation"], "venue": "Advanced Materials Research", "year": 2013, "abstract": "issertation comprehensively reflects the research capacity, innovation ability and literary ability of a postgraduate, and the dissertation evaluation is to give an objective and fair evaluation of the master dissertation.

Methods: SD rats were divided into 2 groups (the number of female and male in each group was the same): control group and fluorosis group. All rats of the fluorosis group were fed corn dried by burning coal from endemic fluorosis areas with high fluoride content (fluoride 17 mg/kg in feed) to establish an animal model of fluorosis. In these rats, dental fluorosis was evaluated. The fluoride content in the urine was measured by fluorine ion-elective electrode method. The hepatic tissue and serum level of malonaldehyde (MDA) and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathion reductase (GR) were measured by biochemical methods. The index signs of liver function were also measured from the serum. Reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot were performed to detect the alterations of Mn-SOD expression in the liver at mRNA and protein levels. Results The dental fluorosis was observed in the fluorosis group, and the incidence was 11/11.

Towards the problem of over-reliance on priori knowledge of the traditional level set segmentation model based on max-flow/min-cut Graph Cut principle and weighted Total Variation (GCTV), this paper proposes a level set segmentation method of combining regional texture features and priori knowledge of color and applies it to greenbelt segmentation in urban remote sensing images. For the color of greenbelts is not reliable for segmentation, Gabor wavelet transform is used to extract image texture features. Then we integrate the extracted features into the GCTV model which contains only priori knowledge of color, and use both the prior knowledge and the targets' texture to constrain the evolving of the level set which can solve the problem of over-reliance on priori knowledge. Meanwhile, the convexity of the corresponding energy functional is ensured by using relaxation and threshold method, and primal-dual algorithm with global relabeling is used to accelerate the evolution of the level set. The experiments show that our method can effectively reduce the dependence on priori knowledge of GCTV, and yields more accurate greenbelt segmentation results. \u00a9 2013 Copyright SPIE.", "pid": "5b5433e3e1cd8e4e15f40fc3"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Jianzhong Wang", "org": "College of Physical Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15128c1d"}, {"name": "Lin Huang", "org": "College of Physical Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15021021"}, {"name": "Xiumei Feng", "org": "College of Physical Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151f147f"}, {"name": "Lingli Wang", "org": "College of Physical Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f54843"}], "title": "Experimental design of magnetic properties of ferromagnetic material measurement based on virtual instruments", "keywords": ["Experimental design", "LabVIEW", "Magnetic properties", "Virtual instrument"], "venue": "Applied Mechanics and Materials", "year": 2012, "abstract": "In the teaching of the physics experiments, the construction and application of teaching research on the virtual experiment system is a newly hot spot, which is needed to be explored in depth at all levels continuously.

It has special significance to research on bubble pulsation parameters of low frequency oscillation in special conditions, using explosion where in high altitudes (500-4500 m) and deep water (5.6-150.6 m). Conclusions can be drawn that the bubble pulsation period increases with increasing altitude, but decreases with increasing water depth, at the same charge condition, due to total hydrostatic pressure. There is a linear attenuation in double logarithm coordinates of the bubble pulsation period and the total hydrostatic pressure water column. Based on this, the coefficient of bubble pulsation period at unstable pressure is obtained. The formula for calculating the following parameters can also be obtained: the bubble pulsation period, specific bubble energy, and net specific bubble energy, which performs work on water medium. Compared to the experimental results of blasting cement mortar blocks, there are no obvious changes of in the breaking rate of large blocks when simulating for a plateau. The rate of breaking for large blocks for deep water increases with the increasing water depth. When the water depth exceeds 110.6 m, only cracks can be observed on the blocks, and the blocks themselves do not disintegrate. This further demonstrates the accuracy of calculation of bubble pulsation parameters at unstable pressures. \u00a9 2013 Taylor & Francis Group.", "pid": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1517b69e"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Mengpeng Cheng", "org": "Applied Technology and Standard Research Center", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f88fe1"}, {"name": "Wenwei Zhang", "org": "Applied Technology and Standard Research Center", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151ce2a9"}, {"name": "Peng Sun", "org": "China Petroleum Pipeline Research Institute", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f4d7af"}, {"name": "Lin Huang", "org": "China Petroleum Pipeline Research Institute", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150f7682"}], "title": "The use of bentonite mud in the MTBM of rock areas", "keywords": ["Bentonite mud", "MTBM"], "venue": "ICPTT 2012: Better Pipeline Infrastructure for a Better Life - Proceedings of the International Conference on Pipelines and Trenchless Technology 2012", "year": 2013, "abstract": "When MTBM is used to construct a tunnel in cohesive soil area, the main force need to resist is adhesive force generated by soil or clay around the machine, which can be reduced by the lubrication.

In rock area, the formation is hard enough to support the pipes, if both entrance and exit are sealed well enough to prevent the lubrication lose, and also make sure the mud be injected continuously and around the pipe all the time which makes the pipes \"float\", frictions between pipes and rocks will be nearly zero under this \"perfect\" status.

However, qualitative analysis was mainly applied for comparison and selection of the previous project proposals. Concerning risk analysis, focus given to the engineering risks while risks of construction period, investment as well as the environment risk resulted therefrom are always ignored. This may probably lead to the proposal selection going to the wrong way. The risk events encountered during implementation of project may lead to delay of the construction period and underestimated (or anticipated) investment, for some cases, temporary construction proposal is adopted to ensure the construction be accomplished as scheduled. In this case, works will be wasted and the whole project will be forced to stay at a passive state. To obtain a reliable, feasible and rational design proposal, it is inevitable to perform comparison and selection of proposals based on the risk analysis.

The severity of coronary atherosclerosis was assessed using the modified Gensini score. One and a half years after discharge, the participants were evaluated at the outpatient clinic or by telephone. The primary outcome was the composite of all-cause death and nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI). RESULTS: A total of 917 (91.1%) patients were evaluated during a mean follow-up period of 17 months. Thirty-five deaths (26 of cardiovascular and 9 of other causes) and 5 nonfatal MIs occurred. The Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale score assessed during hospitalization was significantly and independently associated with the Gensini score (\u03b2 = 1.35, p < .001). Adjusted Cox proportional hazards models showed that anxiety symptoms predicted all-cause death and nonfatal MI (adjusted hazard ratio = 2.43, 95% confidence interval = 1.24-4.75, p = .009). CONCLUSIONS: Anxiety was independently associated with the severity of coronary atherosclerosis and predicted worse outcome in patients with CAD of Chinese Han ethnicity.

The primer for RCA was designed to compose of a two-part sequence, one part of the aptamer sequence directed against OTA while the other part was complementary to the capture probe on the electrode surface. In the presence of target OTA, the primer, originally hybridized with the RCA padlock, is replaced to combine with OTA. This induces the inhibition of RCA and decreases the OTA sensing signal obtained with the electrochemical aptasensor. Under the optimized conditions, ultrasensitive detection of OTA was achieved with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.065 ppt (pg/mL), which is much lower than previously reported. The electrochemical aptasensor was also successfully applied to the determination of OTA in wine samples.

In this study, we describe, for the first time, a multi-labeling based electrochemical biosensor for simultaneous detection of multiple DNA components of GMO products on the same sensing interface. Two-round signal amplification was applied by using both an exonuclease enzyme catalytic reaction and gold nanoparticle-based bio-barcode related strategies, respectively. Simultaneous multiple detections of different DNA components of GMOs were successfully achieved with satisfied sensitivity using this electrochemical biosensor. Furthermore, the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed approach was successfully demonstrated by application to various GMO products, including locally obtained and confirmed commercial GMO seeds and transgenetic plants.

Results show that in Guangzhou the differences between traffic modes are insignificant for the common income group, however the public transport is too expensive for the higher income residents; on the other hand the private mode in Tokyo is costly so the public transport shares a higher rate.

Then, the general information of the children patients, the status of drug use, the off-label use status were statistically analyzed. Results: Totally 755 prescriptions were collected, and 1 044 medication records were analyzed, in which. 38.15% of them were off-label drug use. Dosage (28.43%) and frequency of administration (26.9%) were the most common off-label drug use types. Information not mentioned in children medication class was also much common, accounting for 23.86%. Indications, age and route of administration off-label were relatively less. Age sub-group analysis showed a similar rate of drug use in four groups (P>0.05, chi-square analysis).

We also find that the exchange risk is time-varying and countercyclical, which can help to explain the countercyclicality in equity premium. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier B.V.", "pid": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fed9b6"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Lin Huang", "org": "Research Institute of Economics and Management, Southwestern University of Finance and Economics", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1501d9f5"}, {"name": "Dayong Zhang", "org": "Research Institute of Economics and Management, Southwestern University of Finance and Economics", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1515a43f"}], "title": "Hedging or Speculation: What Can We Learn from the Volume-Return Relationship?", "keywords": ["Chinese stock market", "information asymmetry", "Markov switching", "stock return", "trading volume"], "venue": "Emerging Markets Finance and Trade", "year": 2015, "abstract": "We investigate the volume-return relationship using data from the Chinese stock market.

While the pine wood is infected above four months, the absorption intensity reaches to maximum. However, the calculated relative refractive index compared with the reference signal of PET powder reduces with infection time.

However, with the scale decreasing and the temperature increasing in service condition, the limited reliability of NiCu thin-film material has been a key issue in microelectronics and packaging industry mainly due to the current induced electromigration (EM). In this paper, a sandwich-like NiCu thin-film resistor (Ta/NiCu/Ta) with the thickness of 120 nm was fabricated on the glass substrate by sputtering technique. The resistance of the thin-film structure was proved to increase with time during test. The mean-time-to-failure (MTTF) analysis based on the Black's equation found that the activation energy (Ea) was 0.99 eV and the model parameter for current density of Black's equation was close to 3. Additionally, multi-voids were observed in the thin-film, which can be explained by the Ni diffusion along the barrier layers of Ta crystals.

The failure data with time obtained by the accelerated lifetime test were analyzed by ALTA software based on the Temperature-Non Thermal (T-NT) lognormal model.

Hence, it is meaningful to study the reliability of smaller size and higher density bumps. In this paper, influence of the Cu/Al substrate thickness on the bumps stress, strain and fatigue life during thermal cycle is studied by finite element analysis (FEA), since Cu/Al have large coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and can induce large stress and strain on bumps. In this model, the bumps diameter and height are 15 \u03bcm, interval spacing is 100 \u03bcm, and selected substrate thicknesses are 1 mm, 2 mm and 4 mm, respectively. After 10 thermal cycles, it is observed that compared with the Cu substrate with different thickness, there is an approximate linear relationship between the sum displacement and substrate thickness, while the stress and strain have only little change. And this is same to Al substrate with different thickness. Compared Cu with Al substrate effect on bumps with thickness of 1mm, 2 mm and 4 mm, respectively, the ratio of the sum displacement and $$\u03b1 of Al and Cu have approximate value, 1.35 and 1.43, respectively.

Currently, few studies focus on non-traumatic spinal cord injuries, and there is little information regarding the risk factors for complete injuries. This study aims to describe the demographics and the injury characteristics for both traumatic and non-traumatic spinal cord injuries and to explore the risk factors for complete spinal cord injuries. Methods: A retrospective study was performed by reviewing the medical records of 3,832 patients with spinal cord injuries who were first admitted to the sampled hospitals in Guangdong, China. The demographics and injury characteristics of the patients were described and compared between the different groups using the chi-square test. Logistic regression was conducted to analyze the risk factors for complete spinal cord injuries. Results: The proportion of patients increased from 7.0% to 14.0% from 2003 to 2011. The male-to-female ratio was 3.0:1. The major cause of spinal cord injuries was traffic accidents (21.7%). Many of the injured were workers (36.2%), peasants (22.8%), and unemployed people (13.9%); these occupations accounted for 72.9% of the total sample. A multivariate logistic regression model revealed that the OR (95% CI) for male gender compared to female gender was 1.25 (1.07-1.89), the OR (95%CI) for having a spinal fracture was 1.56 (1.35-2.60), the OR (95%CI) for having a thoracic injury was 1.23 (1.10-2.00), and the OR (95%CI) for having complications was 2.47 (1.96-3.13). Conclusion: The proportion of males was higher than the proportion of females. Workers, peasants and the unemployed comprised the high-risk occupational categories. Male gender, having a spinal fracture, having a thoracic injury, and having complications were the major risk factors for a complete injury. We recommend that preventive measures should focus on high-risk populations, such as young males. \u00a9 2014 Yang et al.", "pid": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e15051c86"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Peng Wang", "org": "Department of Orthopedics, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fde24d"}, {"name": "Yuxi Li", "org": "Department of Orthopedics, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151f7581"}, {"name": "Lin Huang", "org": "Department of Orthopedics, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151c677a"}, {"name": "Jiewen Yang", "org": "Center for Biotherapy, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e15192b66"}, {"name": "Rui Yang", "org": "Department of Orthopedics, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fc70d4"}, {"name": "Wen Deng", "org": "Center for Biotherapy, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f6ea72"}, {"name": "Biling Liang", "org": "Department of Radiology, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University", "id": "5b5433e3e1cd8e4e15f46724"}, {"name": "Lie Dai", "org": "Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fcbf0e"}, {"name": "Qingqi Meng", "org": "Department of Orthopedics, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e15146533"}, {"name": "Liangbin Gao", "org": "Department of Orthopedics, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1506c8ab"}, {"name": "Xiaodong Chen", "org": "Department of Radiology, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151bbab3"}, {"name": "Jun Shen", "org": "Department of Radiology, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e15203ee1"}, {"name": "Yong Tang", "org": "Department of Orthopedics, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e15058b7a"}, {"name": "Xin Zhang", "org": "Department of Orthopedics, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f9efce"}, {"name": "Jingyi Hou", "org": "Department of Orthopedics, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f59e2f"}, {"name": "Jichao Ye", "org": "Department of Orthopedics, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ff4563"}, {"name": "Keng Chen", "org": "Department of Orthopedics, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1515685e"}, {"name": "Zhaopeng Cai", "org": "Department of Orthopedics, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15faa455"}, {"name": "Yanfeng Wu", "org": "Center for Biotherapy, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e1519b6b0"}, {"name": "Huiyong Shen", "org": "Department of Orthopedics, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e150100e8"}], "title": "Effects and safety of allogenic mesenchymal stem cell intravenous infusion in active ankylosing spondylitis patients who failed NSAIDs: A 20-week clinical trial", "keywords": ["Ankylosing spondylitis (AS)", "Autoimmune", "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)", "Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)"], "venue": "Cell Transplantation", "year": 2014, "abstract": "Our objective was to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of intravenous (IV) infusion of allogenic mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients who are refractory to or cannot tolerate the side effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

Whole genome expression profiling analysis of 33,351 genes was performed and differentially expressed genes related to AS were analyzed by GO term analysis and KEGG pathway analysis. Our results showed that in normal media 676 genes were differentially expressed in AS, 354 upregulated and 322 downregulated, while in an inflammatory environment 1767 genes were differentially expressed in AS, 1230 upregulated and 537 downregulated.

At present, nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs are orally taken, but the effects are limited and toxic and side effects are more.

Objective: To investigate the correlation between postoperative joint pain alleviation and allogeneic blood transfusion, and the mechanisms. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed clinical data of 88 ankylosing spondylitis patients combined with kyphosis who received only one section of osteotomy surgery merging hip joint pain. We compared the visual analog scale score of hip joint and detected the variation of leucocytes, lymphocytes and immunoglobulin concentrations before and after the operation in the groups of fresh allogeneic whole blood transfusion, autologous whole blood transfusion, and mixed transfusion of allogeneic and autologous whole blood. Flow cytometry was used to analyze the number and ratio of peripheral blood Th17 cells and Treg cells which were both highly associated with autoimmune diseases. Results and Conclusion: The symptom of hip arthralgia obviously improved in both groups transfused by fresh allogeneic whole blood or allogeneic-autologous mixed whole blood. However, no obvious variation was detected in leucocytes, lymphocytes and immunoglobin concentration. However, flow cytometry results indicated that Th17/Treg proportion associated with autoimmune diseases was increased remarkably in peripheral blood of ankylosing spondylitis patients.

Because of the neutral property (ion-free) of the fullerene derivatives, no dipole moment was introduced at the EEL/active layer interface. A negligible change in open-circuit voltage was observed from inverted PSCs with the neutral fullerene derivative layer. The neutral fullerene derivative layer greatly increased the surface electronic conductivity of the ZnO EEL, suppressed surface charge recombination, and increased the short-circuit current density and fill factor. An overall power conversion efficiency increase of more than 30% from inverted PSCs was obtained.

But LIBS has its shortcomings in detect limit and sensitivity. In this work, heavy metal Cu in Gannan Navel Orange, which is one of famous fruits from Jiangxi of China, was analyzed. In view of LIBS's limit, it is difficult to determinate heavy metals in natural fruits. In this work, nine orange samples were pretreated in 50-500 \u03bcg/mL Cu solution, respectively. Another one orange sample was chosen as a control group without any pollution treatment. Previous researchers observed that the content of heavy metals is much higher in peel than in pulp. So, the content in pulp can be reflected by detecting peel. The real concentrations of Cu in peels were acquired by atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS). A calibration model of Cu I 324.7 and Cu I 327.4 was constructed between LIBS intensity and AAS concentration by six samples. The correlation coefficient of the two models is also 0.95. All of the samples were used to verify the accuracy of the model. The results show that the relative error (RE) between predicted and real concentration is less than 6.5%, and Cu I 324.7 line has smaller RE than Cu I 327.4. The analysis demonstrated that different characteristic lines decided different accuracy. The results prove the feasibility of detecting heavy metals in fruits by LIBS.

The Mountain-River-Lake program since 1980s in Jiangxi Province is a typical successful program of ecological restoration in red soil hilly region, which increased the forest coverage of Jiangxi by 28.55% through implementation of greening barren hill, reforestation, and the Grain for Green Program. This study applied TGTRing and InTEC model simulation, scale transformation from plot to transect and region, field investigation and sampling, dendrochronology method based on tree-ring information, forest inventory data, and carbon budget model, to discuss the effects of forest age and human activities on net primary production (NPP) and carbon sequestration, and then to analysis the annual variation of plantation NPP and carbon sequestration.

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the carbon effects of forestation, and the carbon regulation service of ecological restoration. The results showed that: 1) The NPP simulations for main planting tree species by tree-ring suggested that the NPP value of Masson pine (P. massoniana), Slash pine (P. elliottii) and Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) rises rapidly with the increased forest age and reaches to the peak value in 10a (1058 g m<sup>\u22122</sup> a<sup>\u22121</sup>), 10a (901.09 g m<sup>\u22122</sup> a<sup>\u22121</sup>) and 11a (1305.67 g m<sup>\u22122</sup> a<sup>\u22121</sup>) respectively, and then decreased to stable level in 42a (87.2 g m<sup>\u22122</sup> a<sup>\u22121</sup>), 42a (156.0 g m<sup>\u22122</sup> a<sup>\u22121</sup>) and 40a (33.0 g m<sup>\u22122</sup> a<sup>\u22121</sup>); 2)The NPP trend of plantation from 1980 to 2007 in Jiangxi Province were decreased rapidly before and then increased slowly, which responded the lower quality of plantation. Although the forest coverage increased from 26.98% to 60.05% mainly contributed by the enlarged plantation area, the forest volume per hectare were relatively lower especially for the plantations, because the forest is dominated by secondary natural forest, and middle- aged even young-aged plantation; 3) The variation of carbon sequestration presented as steady trend in the first 8 years before 1988 (2.19-2.37 gC m<sup>\u22122</sup> a<sup>\u22121</sup>) since the beginning of Mountain-River-Lake Program. It then increased rapidly reach to 8.02 gC m<sup>\u22122</sup> a<sup>\u22121</sup> at the thirteen years, and followed by relatively lower increasing rate; 4) The influences of precipitation and temperature on plantation NPP were showed unobvious. However, the elevation greatly impacts the absolute value of NPP, but not the variation trend. In addition, the NPP increased with higher slope; 5) Validated by tree-ring estimated carbon sequestration value and station observed net ecosystem production (NEP) value, we found that modeled NEP shows good consistency than annual net increasing carbon sequestration; 6) The potential carbon sink thorough tree planting is higher than other planting patterns.

Using Alternanthera philoxeroides (alligator weed) as an example, this study tested the hypotheses that physiological integration will improve growth and photosynthetic capacity of submerged ramets during submergence and will promote their recovery following de-submergence. Methods: Connected clones of A. philoxeroides, each consisting of two ramet systems and a stolon internode connecting them, were grown under control (both ramet systems untreated), half-submerged (one ramet system submerged and the other not submerged), fully submerged (both ramet systems submerged), half-shaded (one ramet system shaded and the other not shaded) and full-shaded (both ramet systems shaded) conditions for 30 d and then de-submerged/de-shaded for 20 d. The submerged plants were also shaded to very low light intensities, mimicking typical conditions in turbid floodwater. Key Results After 30 d of submergence, connections between submerged and non-submerged ramets significantly increased growth and carbohydrate accumulation of the submerged ramets, but decreased the growth of the non-submerged ramets. After 20 d of de-submergence, connections did not significantly affect the growth of either de-submerged or non-submerged ramets, but de-submerged ramets had high soluble sugar concentrations, suggesting high metabolic activities. The shift from significant effects of integration on both submerged and non-submerged ramets during the submergence period to little effect during the de-submergence period was due to the quick recovery of growth and photosynthesis. The effects of physiological integration were not found to be any stronger under submergence/de-submergence than under shading/de-shading. Conclusions: The results indicate that it is not just the beneficial effects of physiological integration that are crucial to the survival of riparian clonal plants during periods of submergence, but also the ability to recover growth and photosynthesis rapidly after de-submergence, which thus allows them to spread. \u00a9 2014 The Author 2014.

Strong mechanical disturbance greatly decreased overall biomass, number of shoot nodes and total shoot length, and increased species diversity (evenness) of the total community. It also substantially decreased the growth of the most abundant species (H. verticillata), but did not affect growth of the other four species.

Methods: 2BS cells were cultured in 100 ml small square vase, and inoculated with VZV84-7 strain at a titer of 5.5 lgPFU/ml after formation of a dense monolayer. The inoculum sizes in various vases were 0.02, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 ml respectively. CPEs and their percentages were observed under microscope, and the harvest time was recorded continuously. The virus titer was determined by plaque assay. Results: When the inoculum size was 0.02 ml, most of 2BS cells grew normally and in a polar arrangement. No typical and extensive CPEs were observed, even after the harvest time was delayed. However, when the inoculum size was not less than 0.1 ml, typical and extensive CPEs were observed, and the harvest time decreased gradually with the increasing inoculum size. Only the titer of virus at an inoculum size of 0.02 ml was less than 3.7 lgPFU/ml.

Based on emergy theory and methods, the cultivated land use intensity (I) was composed of production factors intensity (P) and multiples the multiple cropping index (M). On this basis, the paper analyzed the temporal and spatial change law of all the five production factor intensities, which are farm machinery, fertilizer, pesticide, agricultural film and labor, and the multiple cropping index in China from 1990 to 2011. The results showed: Firstly, during the past 22 years, the farm machinery intensity, fertilizer intensity, pesticide intensity, and agricultural film intensity were all in a linear growth trend, and their annual growth rates were 6.59%, 2.89%, 3.88% and 7.42% respectively; while the labor intensity was in a linear decreasing trend, and its decreasing rate was 5.10 percent. In 1996, the possession of industrial supplementary energy intensity, including farm machinery, fertilizer, pesticide, and agricultural film, in the total production factors intensity first exceeded 50 percent, which meant that China had entered the modern agriculture stage in the middle of 1990s. During the study period, multiple cropping index was also in a linear growth, and the annual growth rate is 0.79%; its total increasing rate was 0.1794 in the past 22 years, and was the major driving force of the increase of land use intensity. Secondly, in 1996, the provinces with high labor intensity and low development of modern agriculture were mainly located in the western part of China, and the typical characteristics of these provinces were that they were all rated with a relatively low level of social and economic development; While in the provinces with high development of economic levels and a good industrial foundation, the labor intensity was low and development of modern agriculture was high. From 1996 to 2008, most provinces in the western part of China and some of the coastal provinces in the eastern part of China, labor intensity decreased a lot; while in the provinces with high economic development and the provinces with more land and fewer persons, labor intensity decreased only a little. In the provinces with high economic development in the eastern coastal part of China and some major grain producing areas, industrial supplementary energy intensity increased a lot; In the provinces with high development of modern agriculture, industrial supplementary energy intensity increased only a little. Thirdly, from 1996 to 2008, in the major rice producing areas in southern part of China, the multiple cropping index decreased a lot, which was the major reason that contributed to the decreasing of their land use intensity; In most provinces in the northern part of China, the multiple cropping index increased a lot, which was the major reason that improved their land use intensity.", "pid": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fef875"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Chengsheng Yao", "org": "College of Economics and Management, Nanchang University", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151a7b76"}, {"name": "Yi Teng", "org": "College of Economics and Management, Nanchang University", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e150143fc"}, {"name": "Lin Huang", "org": "Foreign Languages College, Jiangxi Normal University", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f99a9d"}], "title": "Evaluation index system construction and empirical analysis on food security in China", "keywords": ["Agriculture", "China", "Comprehensive evaluation", "Food system", "Grains", "Indexes system", "Security"], "venue": "Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering", "year": 2015, "abstract": "Food security is not only one of the most important issues that Chinese government attaches great importance to, but also one of the hot topics that researchers focus on. In order to make a comprehensive analysis on China's food security, this paper, from the perspectives of its four subsystems including food production resources, food availability and stability, food access, and food utilization, constructed an evaluation indexes system on food security, and further made a quantitative assessment about the state of food security in China from 1990 to 2011. The results showed that: in China, during the period of 1990-2011, as to the development of food security system, it could be divided into steady increase stage (1990-1998), rapid decrease stage (1999-2003) and rapid increase stage (2004-2011). As to the four food security subsystems, the development of food production resources subsystem could be divided into slow decrease stage (1990-2002) and rapid increase stage (2003-2011); the development of food availability and stability subsystem could be divided into fluctuating increase stage (1990-1998), rapid decrease stage (1999-2003) and steady increase stages (2004-2011); the development of food access subsystem could be divided into slow increase stage (1990-2004) and rapid increase stage (2005-2011); while the development of food utilization subsystem had only one stage, with its index constantly on the rise. As to the impact of the four subsystems on food security system, food production resources subsystem had the greatest impact, while food availability and stability came next, whose weight were 0.377 and 0.302 respectively. Using pathological diagnosis methods, this paper also analyzed the major factors hindering China's food security system from 1990 to 2010, and listed the first five obstacle factors in descending order of hindrance. It pointed out that, from 1990 to 2000, state financial support for agriculture, total grain production and road density were the key factors that had posed the greatest hindrance to the food security system. The obstacle degree of the three factors in 1990, 1995 and 2000 were 44.48%, 44.05% and 44.29%, respectively. However, from 2000 to 2010, the obstacle degree of the three factors on food security system was on the decrease, while the obstacle degree of per capital cultivated land was on the rise. In 2010, the factor of per capital cultivated land became the greatest obstacle to food security system, whose obstacle degree was 29.79%; the next greatest obstacle factors were net grain importation and domestic food price index, whose obstacle degree were 16.93% and 11.87%, respectively. As to the obstacle degree of the four food security subsystems, food production resources subsystem had the maximum obstacle degree to food security system, food availability and stability subsystem coming next, with their obstacle degrees rising from 31.32% and 26.34% in 1990 to 43.69% and 39.32% in 2010, respectively. Finally, based on the development characteristics of China's food security system, this paper proposed some relevant suggestions and policies to improve the state of China's food security.", "pid": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1516a50b"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Ren-An Qin", "org": "Guangzhou General Medicine and Pharmaceutical Research Institute", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150a4a29"}, {"name": "Juan Lin", "org": "Jinan University College of Pharmacy", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15125814"}, {"name": "Chuyuan Li", "org": "Guangzhou General Medicine and Pharmaceutical Research Institute", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e151615ca"}, {"name": "Wenjuan Fu", "org": "Jinan University College of Pharmacy", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f6b3e5"}, {"name": "Chunyan Huang", "org": "Jinan University College of Pharmacy", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1504ce28"}, {"name": "Xuemei Yu", "org": "Jinan University College of Pharmacy", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e150388b8"}, {"name": "Lin Huang", "org": "Guangzhou General Medicine and Pharmaceutical Research Institute", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1501be57"}, {"name": "Hong Nie", "org": "Jinan University College of Pharmacy", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150beb08"}], "title": "Study of the protective mechanisms of Compound Danshen Tablet (Fufang Danshen Pian) against myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury via the Akt-eNOS signaling pathway in rats", "keywords": ["Akt", "Compound Danshen Tablet", "eNOS", "Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury", "Protective mechanisms", "Signaling pathway"], "venue": "Journal of Ethnopharmacology", "year": 2014, "abstract": "Ethnopharmacological relevance: Compound Danshen Tablet (CDT), an herbal preparation consisting of Salvia miltiorrhiza (Radix and rhizome of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bge.), Notoginseng (Radix and rhizome of Panax notoginseng (Burk.)

Nanoscale delivery carriers can increase the oral bioavailability of BH. Chitosan has interesting biopharmaceutical properties such as nontoxicity, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and mucoadhesiveness, and the ability to open epithelial tight junctions. This study aims to engineer a chitosan-coated nano-liposomal carrier for the oral delivery of BH. The engineered formulation had a size in the nanoscale range. Chitosan-coated nano-liposomes displayed better stability and slower BH release in the simulated gastrointestinal (GI) environment as compared to the uncoated ones. All values of pharmacokinetic analysis for chitosan-coated nano-liposomes were higher than for uncoated ones. These findings demonstrate that chitosan-coated nano-liposomes are more efficient than uncoated ones for the oral delivery of BH. It can be concluded that the stability and delayed BH release in the simulated GI environment were improved with engineered chitosan-coated nano-liposomes. Moreover, since desirable in vitro and in vivo characteristics were achieved, they are promising release devices for the oral delivery of BH increasing the bioavailability of the drug.

We conducted accelerated thermal aging tests using transformer's oil-paper insulation at 130\u2103. In the tests, the acid value, furfural concentration, and dielectric loss factor of the oil-paper insulation were measured. Furthermore, we analyzed the reaction mechanisms of the acidic products during the thermal aging process, which were then compared with the variation of furfural concentration and dielectric as the main aging characteristic parameters. According to the experiments, during the thermal aging process, the aging reaction that generates acidic products could be divided into two phases, namely, the induction phase and the developed phase. The furfural content of transformer oil begins to decline in the late stage of the induction phase, and since then it is not able to reflect the aging situation of insulation accurately. In the developed phase, the reaction rate is notably larger than that in the introduction phase, i.e. it increases by about 4~10 times. The variations of oil dielectric loss factor and acid value are in accordance with each other, and the sharp increase of oil acid value corresponds to the significant decline of oil-paper insulation performance.

However, studies of associations between AMACR gene polymorphisms and prostate cancer risk reported inconsistent results. Therefore, we conducted the present meta-analysis to clarify the link between AMACR gene polymorphisms and prostate cancer risk. Materials and Methods: A literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang and Weipu databases. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) were calculated to assess the strength of any association between AMACR polymorphisms and prostate cancer risk. Subgroup analyses by ethnicity, source of controls, quality control and sample size were also conducted. Results: Five studies covering 3,313 cases and 3,676 controls on five polymorphisms (D175G, M9V, S201L, K277E and Q239H) were included in this meta-analysis. Significant associations were detected between prostate cancer and D175G (dominant model: OR=0.89, 95%CI=0.80-0.99, P=0.04) and M9V (dominant model: OR=0.87, 95%CI=0.78-0.97, P=0.01) polymorphisms as well as that in subgroup analyses. We also observed significant decreased prostate cancer risk in the dominant model (OR=0.90, 95%CI=0.81-0.99, P=0.04) for the S201L polymorphism. However, K277E and Q239H polymorphisms did not appear to be related to prostate cancer risk. Conclusions: The current meta-analysis indicated that D175G and M9V polymorphisms of the AMACR gene are related to prostate cancer. The S201L polymorphism might also be linked with prostate cancer risk to some extent. However, no association was observed between K277E or Q239H polymorphisms and susceptibility to prostate cancer.", "pid": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1516fd2f"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Cheng-Di Wang", "org": "Department of Respiratory Medicine, West China Hospital, Sichuan University", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e1500b6ff"}, {"name": "Nan Chen", "org": "West China School of Medicine/West China Hospital, Sichuan University", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f4a502"}, {"name": "Lin Huang", "org": "West China School of Medicine/West China Hospital, Sichuan University", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1513ec3c"}, {"name": "Jia-Rong Wang", "org": "West China School of Medicine/West China Hospital, Sichuan University", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e150631fb"}, {"name": "Zhi-Yuan Chen", "org": "West China School of Medicine/West China Hospital, Sichuan University", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150a7173"}, {"name": "Ya-Mei Jiang", "org": "West China School of Medicine/West China Hospital, Sichuan University", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e15157f8b"}, {"name": "Ya-Zhou He", "org": "West China School of Medicine/West China Hospital, Sichuan University", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150eed14"}, {"name": "Yu-Lin Ji", "org": "Department of Respiratory Medicine, West China Hospital, Sichuan University", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151ba2e8"}], "title": "Impact of CYP1A1 Polymorphisms on Susceptibility to Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: A Meta-Analysis", "venue": "BioMed Research International", "year": 2015, "abstract": "Objective. Several studies have evaluated the association between CYP1A1 polymorphisms and the susceptibility of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with inconclusive results. We performed the first comprehensive meta-analysis to summarize the association between CYP1A1 polymorphisms and COPD risk. Method. A systematic literature search was conducted (up to April 2015) in five online databases: PubMed, EMBASE, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), WeiPu, and WanFang databases. The strength of association was calculated by odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). Results. Seven case-control studies with 1050 cases and 1202 controls were included. Our study suggested a significant association between the MspI polymorphism and COPD risk (CC versus TC + TT: OR = 1.57, CI: 1.09-2.26, P=0.02; CC versus TT: OR = 1.73, CI: 1.18-2.55, P=0.005). For the Ile/Val polymorphism, a significant association with COPD risk was observed (GG versus AG + AA: OR = 2.75, CI: 1.29-5.84, P = 0.009; GG versus AA: OR = 3.23, CI: 1.50-6.93, P=0.003; AG versus AA: OR = 1.39, CI: 1.01-1.90, P=0.04).

Materials and Methods: Serum and fresh tissue samples were collected from 114 EOC patients. RUNX3, TFPI2 and OPCML served as target genes. Methylation levels of tissues were assessed by multiplex nested methylated specific PCR, the results being compared with those for carcinoma antigen 125 (CA125). Results: The serum free deoxyribose nucleic acid (DNA) methylation spectrum of EOC patients was completely contained in the DNA spectrum of cancer tissues, providing an accurate reflection of tumor DNA methylation conditions. Serum levels of CA125 and free DNA methylation in the EOC group were evidently higher than those in benign lesion and control groups (p < 0.05). Patients with early EOC had markedly lower serum CA125 than those with advanced EOC (p < 0.05), but there was no significant difference in free DNA methylation (p > 0.05). The sensitivity, specificity and positive predicative value (PPV) of multiplex nested methylated specific PCR were significantly higher for detection of all patients and those with early EOC than those for CA125 (p < 0.05). In the detection of patients with advanced EOC, the PPV of CA125 detection was obviously lower than that of multiplex nested methylated specific PCR (p > 0.05), but there was no significant difference in sensitivity (p > 0.05).

The scar biopsies were collected pre-treatment, 1 and 3 months post-intervention for both clinical and histopathological examinations. Clinical assessments demonstrated significant improvement in the thickness and redness of the scars after PT. Histological examination revealed that cell density in the dermal layer was markedly reduced in the 3-months post-pressurized scar tissues, while the arrangement of the collagen fiber was changed from nodular to wave-like pattern. The \u03b1-smooth muscle actin immunoreactivity was significantly decreased after 1-month pressure treatment. There was a significant reduction of myofibroblasts population and a concomitant increase in the apoptotic index in the dermal layer in the 3-months' post-pressurized scars. A significant negative correlation was found between the myofibroblasts population and the apoptotic index. The keratinocyte proliferation was found inhibited after PT.

The cell line was characterized and was found that there were no significant differences on cell proliferation rate and recruitment of monocytes when compared with the wild type GCT stromal cells. We delivered the Luc-G33 cells either subcutaneously on the back or to the tibiae of the nude mice. The presence of viable Luc-G33 cells was assessed using real-time live imaging by the IVIS 200 bioluminescent imaging (BLI) system. The tumor cells initially propagated and remained viable on site for 7 weeks in the subcutaneous tumor model. We also tested in vivo antitumor effects of Zoledronate (ZOL) and Geranylgeranyl transferase-I inhibitor (GGTI-298) alone or their combinations in Luc-G33-transplanted nude mice. ZOL alone at 400 \u03bcg/kg and the co-treatment of ZOL at 400 \u03bcg/kg and GGTI-298 at 1.16 mg/kg reduced tumor cell viability in the model.

METHODS: Newborn male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into either a maternal separation group or a control group. Rats in the maternal separation group received maternal separation from postnatal days 2-15. At the 8th postnatal week, the abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) and electromyographic (EMG) amplitude of the external oblique muscle in response to graded colorectal distension (CRD) were examined. The levels of serum nesfatin-1 and glucocorticoid were detected using ELISA. RESULTS: At the 8th postnatal week, the body weight of rats in the maternal separation group was significantly lower than that in the normal control group. The levels of serum nesfatin-1 and glucocorticoid in maternal separation group were statistically higher than those in the control group. The level of glucocorticoid was positively correlated with serum nesfatin-1 level. When the balloon pressure was set at 40, 60 and 80 mmHg, AWR score and EMG amplitude in the maternal separation group were significantly higher than those in the normal control group. AWR score and EMG amplitude in the maternal separation group were positively correlated with the level of serum nesfatin-1. CONCLUSION: Rats subjected to maternal separation showed a higher AWR score and EMG amplitude, as well as elevated levels of serum nesfatin-1. Visceral hypersensitivity induced by neonatal maternal separation may be associated with elevated level of serum nesfatin-1.", "pid": "5b5433e3e1cd8e4e15f4000f"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Lin Huang", "org": "College of Life Science, Qingdao University", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150a5c2c"}, {"name": "Guiyang Li", "org": "National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151c8581"}, {"name": "Zhaolan Mo", "org": "National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f815c7"}, {"name": "Peng Xiao", "org": "Key Laboratory of Experimental Marine Biology, Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1501f62b"}, {"name": "Jie Li", "org": "National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e15136b27"}, {"name": "Jie Huang", "org": "National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f4e6f2"}], "title": "De Novo assembly of the Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) spleen transcriptome to identify putative genes involved in immunity", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "year": 2015, "abstract": "Background: Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) is an economically important marine fish in Asia and has suffered from disease outbreaks caused by various pathogens, which requires more information for immune relevant genes on genome background. However, genomic and transcriptomic data for Japanese flounder remain scarce, which limits studies on the immune system of this species. In this study, we characterized the Japanese flounder spleen transcriptome using an Illumina paired-end sequencing platform to identify putative genes involved in immunity. Methodology/Principal Findings: A cDNA library from the spleen of P. olivaceus was constructed and randomly sequenced using an Illumina technique. The removal of low quality reads generated 12,196,968 trimmed reads, which assembled into 96,627 unigenes. A total of 21,391 unigenes (22.14%) were annotated in the NCBI Nr database, and only 1.1% of the BLASTx top-hits matched P. olivaceus protein sequences. Approximately 12,503 (58.45%) unigenes were categorized into three Gene Ontology groups, 19,547 (91.38%) were classified into 26 Cluster of Orthologous Groups, and 10,649 (49.78%) were assigned to six Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways. Furthermore, 40,928 putative simple sequence repeats and 47, 362 putative single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified. Importantly, we identified 1,563 putative immune-associated unigenes that mapped to 15 immune signaling pathways. Conclusions/Significance The P. olivaceus transciptome data provides a rich source to discover and identify new genes, and the immune-relevant sequences identified here will facilitate our understanding of the mechanisms involved in the immune response.

Although many efforts have been made in the field during the latest 2 decades, the progress is still far behind its counterpart, N-termini, and it necessitates more novel or optimized methods. Herein, we report an optimized C-termini identification approach based on the C-terminal amine-based isotope labeling of substrates (C-TAILS) method. We optimized the amidation reaction conditions to achieve higher yield of fully amidated product. We evaluated different carboxyl and amine blocking reagents and found the superior performance of Ac-NHS and ethanolamine. Replacement of dimethylation with acetylation for Lys blocking resulted in the identification of 232 C-terminal peptides in an Escherichia coli sample, about 42% higher than the conventional C-TAILS. A systematic data analysis revealed that the optimized method is unbiased to the number of lysine in peptides, more reproducible and with higher MASCOT scores. Moreover, the introduction of the Single-Charge Ion Inclusion (SCII) method to alleviate the charge deficiency of small peptides allowed an additional 26% increase in identification number. With the optimized method, we identified 481 C-terminal peptides corresponding to 369 C-termini in E. coli in a triplicate experiments using 80 \u03bcg each. Our optimized method would benefit the deep screening of C-terminome and possibly help discover some novel C-terminal modifications.

However, molecular mechanism behind this formula remains unknown. Here, we systematically analyzed targets of the ingredients in SMBJT to evaluate its potential molecular mechanism. First, we collected 1,267 targets from our previously published database, the Traditional Chinese Medicine Integrated Database (TCMID). Next, we conducted gene ontology and pathway enrichment analyses for these targets and determined that they were enriched in metabolism (amino acids, fatty acids, etc.) and signaling pathways (chemokines, Toll-like receptors, adipocytokines, etc.). 96 targets, which are known SLE disease proteins, were identified as essential targets and the rest 1,171 targets were defined as common targets of this formula. The essential targets directly interacted with SLE disease proteins. Besides, some common targets also had essential connections to both key targets and SLE disease proteins in enriched signaling pathway, e.g. toll-like receptor signaling pathway. We also found distinct function of essential and common targets in immune system processes. This multi-level approach to deciphering the underlying mechanism of SMBJT treatment of SLE details a new perspective that will further our understanding of TCM formulas.", "pid": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1503e82e"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Dan Zi", "org": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e151fcd2f"}, {"name": "Zhi-Wei Zhou", "org": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150a56cc"}, {"name": "Ying-Jie Yang", "org": "Department of Gynecologic Oncology Surgery", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e15122813"}, {"name": "Lin Huang", "org": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e150287c5"}, {"name": "Zun-Lun Zhou", "org": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1509190a"}, {"name": "Shu-Ming He", "org": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1518fc1f"}, {"name": "Zhi-Xu He", "org": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15ff1ece"}, {"name": "Shu-Feng Zhou", "org": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1512e818"}], "title": "Danusertib induces apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and autophagy but inhibits epithelial to mesenchymal transition involving PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in human ovarian cancer cells", "keywords": ["Apoptosis", "Autophagy", "Cell cycle", "Danusertib", "Epithelial to mesenchymal transition", "Ovarian cancer"], "venue": "International Journal of Molecular Sciences", "year": 2015, "abstract": "Ovarian carcinoma (OC) is one of the most common gynecological malignancies, with a poor prognosis for patients at advanced stage.
