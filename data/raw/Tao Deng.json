The former one provides the probabilistic description of ground classification along tunnel alignment according to the geology information revealed from boring holes. The latter one provides the probabilistic description of expected cost for each interested operation according to the survey feedbacks among practitioners. Then an engineering application to Chuanshi Tunnel is well presented to demonstrate how the ground condition and the construction cost are estimated in a quantitative and probabilistic way. It facilitates both the owners and the contractors to be aware of the risk they should carry before construction, and it is meaningful for both tendering and bidding. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd.", "pid": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150e2ad7"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Tao Deng", "org": "Department of Automation, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Ministry of Education of China", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1509d907"}, {"name": "Hesheng Wang", "org": "Department of Automation, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Ministry of Education of China", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e15135d38"}, {"name": "Weidong Chen", "org": "Department of Automation, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Ministry of Education of China", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fc9513"}, {"name": "Xiaozhou Wang", "org": "Shanghai Chest Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151b40c5"}, {"name": "Rolf Pfeifer", "org": "Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Department of Informatics, University of Zurich", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1517b5d7"}], "title": "Development of a new cable-driven soft robot for cardiac ablation", "venue": "2013 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics, ROBIO 2013", "year": 2013, "abstract": "A new cable-driven soft endoscopic system is designed for cardiac ablation in a minimally invasive manner in this paper.

Due to soft material it made of and nearly infinite degree of freedom it owns, the soft robotic manipulator has higher security and dexterity than traditional rigid-link manipulator, which make it suitable to perform tasks in complex environments that is narrow, confined and unstructured. Though the soft robotic manipulator possesses advantages above, it is not an easy thing for it to achieve precise position control. In order to solve this problem, a kinematic model based on piecewise constant curvature hypothesis is proposed. Through building up three spaces and two mappings, the relationship between the length variables of 4 cables and the position and orientation of the soft robotic manipulator end-effector is obtained. Afterwards, a depth-independent image Jacobian matrix is introduced and an image-based visual servo controller is presented. Applied by adaptive algorithm, the controller could estimate unknown position of the feature point online, and then Lyapunov theory is used to prove the stability of the proposed controller. At last, experiments are conducted to demonstrate rationality and validity of the kinematic model and adaptive visual servo controller. \u00a9 2013 IEEE.", "pid": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151b1e5e"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Jianhui Jin", "org": "Key Laboratory of Humid Subtropical Ecosystem and Geography, Ministry of Education", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151d56eb"}, {"name": "Zhizhong Li", "org": "Key Laboratory of Humid Subtropical Ecosystem and Geography, Ministry of Education", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f7a074"}, {"name": "Fangen Hu", "org": "Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151af406"}, {"name": "Hui Zhang", "org": "School of Geography and Tourism, Guizhou Normal College", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150e632b"}, {"name": "Xianli Wang", "org": "School of Geography Science, Fujian Normal University", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1519073d"}, {"name": "Jing Xia", "org": "School of Geography Science, Fujian Normal University", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e15187503"}, {"name": "Feng Jiang", "org": "School of Geography Science, Fujian Normal University", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1510f63d"}, {"name": "Tao Deng", "org": "School of Geography Science, Fujian Normal University", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1509d907"}, {"name": "Shuyu Jin", "org": "School of Geography Science, Fujian Normal University", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f8160b"}, {"name": "Xiuming Liu", "org": "Key Laboratory of Humid Subtropical Ecosystem and Geography, Ministry of Education", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f7ea50"}], "title": "Mid-Holocene coastal environment and human activities recorded by a coastal dune in Fujian Province, China", "keywords": ["Coastal dune", "East Asia monsoon", "Human activities", "OSL", "Sea level"], "venue": "Acta Geographica Sinica", "year": 2015, "abstract": "A coastal dune, Dongshan (DS) dune in Changle of China's Fujian Province is selected as a research object based on the systematic field investigation.

According to the characteristic of the novel series-parallel architecture, the switching boundary condition between series and parallel mode as well as the control rules of the power-balancing strategy are developed.

The expression of H pylori was observed in 20 of the 26 patients with chronic hepatitis combined with antrum inflammation (76.9%). No significant difference existed between the cirrhosis group and the chronic hepatitis group. The rates of HBV antigen expression in the H pylori positive and negative gastric antrum mucosa were 69.8% (37/53) and 73.7% (14/19), respectively (P >0.05). Conclusions: Over-expression of HBV antigen (HBsAg and HBcAg) coexists with the expression of H pylori antigen in the H pylori infected gastric mucosa. Difficult clearance of HBsAg and HBcAg from gastric epithelial cells may be related to persistent H pylori infection. Early treatment of H pylori infection may be beneficial to the prognosis of patients with chronic liver disease. \u00a9 2004, Hepatobiliary Pancreat Dis Int.

With a thick sequence of Tertiary sediments and associated fossil records, the Danghe area is one of few places on the Tibetan Plateau that can offer integrated studies of its tectonic history, depositional environment, and biological records, including vertebrate and plant fossils. Past studies, however, have not been able to capitalize on the paleontological data or were often misguided by an outdated notion of regional chronology. Incorrect age estimates in these studies often have profound effects on tectonic interpretations. We present new stratigraphic and paleontologic evidence from the Danghe area and demonstrate a new chronologic scheme that indicates a much younger age for the majority of the sediments. We recognize three packages of sediments in the Danghe area: (1) Oligocene Paoniuquan (new name) Formation, basal, predominantly fine-grained, dark purple mudstones and siltstones that include the classic Yindirte Fauna, which forms the basis of the Tabenbulukian mammal age; (2) early Miocene to early late Miocene Tiejianggou (new name) Formation that contains a new platybelodont proboscidean in a coarsening-upward sequence terminating in a massive conglomerate; and (3) an unnamed late Neogene formation that contains another coarsening-upward sequence. In light of our new stratigraphic framework, we reinterpret a previously published magnetic column for the middle sequence in Xishuigou as representing chrons C6n through C4Ar corresponding to a span of about 20-9.3 Ma, much younger than has been realized so far. This new chronological framework suggests a depositional history of the Danghe Nanshan that spans at least the early Oligocene through late Miocene, to possibly Pliocene. Early depositions during the Oligocene through middle Miocene are dominated by fine-grained sediments indicating a distant source of sedimentation. Paleontological data suggest a relatively dry environment, as is typical of northern China today. By late Miocene (around 9-12 Ma), the Danghe area began to receive coarse sediments and was much closer to the mountain front. The new stratigraphic framework indicates an earlier onset of sedimentation than has generally been assumed, but also suggests the presence of sediments much younger than many have realized. \u00a9 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Shared derived characters that support this relationship include: anterior rims of orbit far behind the level of M3; raised lower rim of orbit; long, wide, fused nasal bones that angle ventrally; a retracted nasal notch at the level of the P4/M1 boundary; broadly separated parietal crests; tooth rows restricted to the anterior half of skull; extremely expanded hypocones of molars; very narrow metalophs; and a lingually elongated protoloph of M3. Parelasmotherium was obviously a grazer, as shown by the high crown, strong wear, massive cement, and wrinkled enamel on its teeth. The coexistence of Parelasmotherium and Ningxiatherium in the Linxia Basin indicates that the ecological differentiation occurred during the early late Miocene. The two genera occupied different ecological niches with distinct diets, grazing grasses for Parelasmotherium and browsing leaves for Ningxiatherium. \u00a9 2007 by the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology.", "pid": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150a2043"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Xiaoming Wang", "org": "Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fd286a"}, {"name": "Zhuding Qiu", "org": "Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151e2812"}, {"name": "Qiang Li", "org": "Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1515fbfd"}, {"name": "Banyue Wang", "org": "Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f73ce8"}, {"name": "Zhanxiang Qiu", "org": "Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e1505d120"}, {"name": "William R.

Although constituting the first known fossil vertebrates of the Tibetan Plateau and discovered in early scientific expeditions in the 1930s, mammalian fossils from Qaidam Basin have not played a significant role in studying the basin stratigraphy. Our explorations in the Qaidam Basin during the past 8\u00a0years have resulted in the first well documented collection of fossil vertebrates from there. In addition to being the best organisms for terrestrial biostratigraphy in the Cenozoic, the new fossil vertebrates offer a unique window into the ancient biotas that chronicle the late Cenozoic uplift of the plateau and associated environmental changes. Here we establish for the first time a faunal sequence of early Oligocene to early Pliocene age. Four mammalian faunas are recognized: Olongbuluk Mammal Fauna (middle Miocene), Tuosu Mammal Fauna (early late Miocene), Shengou Mammal Fauna (early late Miocene), and Huaitoutala Mammal Fauna (early Pliocene). All four mammal faunas can be directly or indirectly tied to a paleomagnetic section in the Olongbuluk-Huaitoutala area, permitting robust calibration of the chronology of these faunas. At least four fish faunas are also found: Lulehe Fish Fauna (late early to early late Oligocene), Shengou Fish Fauna (early late Miocene), Eboliang Fish Fauna (late late Miocene to early Pliocene), and Yahu Fish Fauna (early Pliocene). The fish faunas represent the only records of their respective times in the Tibetan Plateau and thus by themselves cannot be used for age determination. However, these fish faunas are either integrated into paleomagnetic sections or directly tied to mammal faunas of known ages, permitting independent assessment of their chronology. Zoogeographically, Qaidam mammal faunas show increasing endemism through time, presumably related to topographic barriers formed by the growth and uplift of the Tibetan Plateau and to climatic changes triggered by the same tectonic process. Fishes that were trapped in internally drained basins developed pachyostotic morphologies caused by hypersaline environments, which are associated with the increasing aridity of the Tibetan Plateau since early Pliocene. \u00a9 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Previous research has shown that the N-terminal region of the PA subunit of influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus is involved in promoter binding. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we extend our studies of the influenza RNA polymerase to that of influenza strains A/HongKong/156/97 (H5N1) and A/Vietnam/1194/04 (H5N1). Both H5N1 strains, originally isolated from patients in 1997 and 2004, showed significantly higher polymerase activity compared with two classical human strains, A/WSN/33 (H1N1) and A/NT/60/68 (H3N2) in vitro. This increased polymerase activity correlated with enhanced promoter binding. The N-terminal region of the PA subunit was the major determinant of this enhanced promoter activity. Conclusions/Significance: Overall we suggest that the N-terminal region of the PA subunit of two recent H5N1 strains can influence promoter binding and we speculate this may be a factor in their virulence. \u00a9 2009 Kashiwagi et al.", "pid": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151d3ecd"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Puwei Yuan", "org": "National Laboratory of Biomacromolecules", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150bf238"}, {"name": "Mark Bartlam", "org": "College of Life Sciences", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1508a974"}, {"name": "Zhiyong Lou", "org": "Laboratory of Structural Biology", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e151239d1"}, {"name": "Shoudeng Chen", "org": "National Laboratory of Biomacromolecules", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e15169a5f"}, {"name": "Jie Zhou", "org": "National Laboratory of Biomacromolecules", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ff647c"}, {"name": "Xiaojing He", "org": "National Laboratory of Biomacromolecules", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15faa050"}, {"name": "Zongyang Lv", "org": "National Laboratory of Biomacromolecules", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f8549b"}, {"name": "Ruowen Ge", "org": "Department of Biological Sciences", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f4ab02"}, {"name": "Xuemei Li", "org": "Laboratory of Structural Biology", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e1500410c"}, {"name": "Tao Deng", "org": "Sir William Dunn School of Pathology", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1509d907"}, {"name": "Ervin Fodor", "org": "Sir William Dunn School of Pathology", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151b3c22"}, {"name": "Zihe Rao", "org": "Laboratory of Structural Biology", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f9db01"}, {"name": "Yingfang Liu", "org": "National Laboratory of Biomacromolecules", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150a50b6"}], "title": "Crystal structure of an avian influenza polymerase PA N reveals an endonuclease active site", "venue": "Nature", "year": 2009, "abstract": "The heterotrimeric influenza virus polymerase, containing the PA, PB1 and PB2 proteins, catalyses viral RNA replication and transcription in the nucleus of infected cells.

Here we report the 2.2 ngstr\u00f6m () crystal structure of the N-terminal 197 residues of PA, termed PA N, from an avian influenza H5N1 virus. The PA N structure has an \u03b1/\u0392 architecture and reveals a bound magnesium ion coordinated by a motif similar to the (P)DX N (D/E)XK motif characteristic of many endonucleases. Structural comparisons and mutagenesis analysis of the motif identified in PA N provide further evidence that PA N holds an endonuclease active site. Furthermore, functional analysis with in vivo ribonucleoprotein reconstitution and direct in vitro endonuclease assays strongly suggest that PA N holds the endonuclease active site and has critical roles in endonuclease activity of the influenza virus polymerase, rather than PB1. The high conservation of this endonuclease active site among influenza strains indicates that PA N is an important target for the design of new anti-influenza therapeutics. \u00a9 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Sinosenecio jishouensis D. G. Zhang, Y. Liu & Q. E. Yang is a new Asteraceous species (genus Sinosenecio) recently ascertained. According to IUCN Red Species List S. jishouensis ranked as the Critically Endangered Species (CR), for its extremely small and rare populations. However, little is known about the reproductive biology of this endangered species. Our results demonstrated that S. jishouensis occurred only in the Dehang Geological Park, Jishou City, Hunan Province. S. jishouensis distributed on an altitude of 260-340 m, and the environmental conditions were mildly warm and relatively humid. The yellow-red soil in its habitat, which was rich in calcium, has a pH value of about 6.8. There were totally 2000-3000 individuals distributed in 3 populations in the Dehang Geological Park, suggesting this species is at risk of becoming extinct. The Canyon Fall population was the largest one, with nearly 2000 individuals, which is an important population for conservation priorities. Its shoots began to sprout in Early Februray, and the scape appeared by the end of February or the early March; the flowering season was from mid- March to mid-May. S. jishouensis has herkogamy flowers with a 3-5d longevity. For a single capitulum, it could last 18 days. Secondary pollen presentation, a typical phenomenon in Asteraceae, were conspicuous during floret openning. Our observation suggested that Caliroa sawfly, Apis cerana and syrphid fly were the effective pollinators and visited flowers for collecting pollen. Our study indicated that floral structures, flowering synchronizatio, and \"brush-like mechanism\" were floral adaptations to improve the effective pollination. Furthermore, characteristics of its breeding system, such as small achenes without pappus and relying mainly on both clone production and sexual production, ensure reproductive success even when pollinators are scarce in the Canyon Fall special habitat. It may be adaptive strategies to the Canyon Fall special habitat. On the other hand, the human-made interference, the scarce flower-visiting pollination, low visiting frequency and efficiency, the small number of seeds with poor quality and dispersal, together with its strict demands on habitat conditions were the main causes for the rare and endangered status of S. jishouensis.", "pid": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150af699"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Shi Qi Wang", "org": "Key Laboratory of Evolutionary Systematics of Vertebrates", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1509e64f"}, {"name": "Tao Deng", "org": "Key Laboratory of Evolutionary Systematics of Vertebrates", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1509d907"}], "title": "The first Choerolophodon (Proboscidea, Gomphotheriidae) skull from China", "keywords": ["China", "Choerolophodon", "early Miocene", "gomphotheres", "Linxia Basin"], "venue": "Science China Earth Sciences", "year": 2011, "abstract": "Here we report the first discovery of a relatively complete skull of Choerolophodon from the late early Miocene Dalanggou quarry of Linxia Basin, Gansu Province in China.

These environmental changes appear to be driven by regional-scale tectonics. The oxygen isotope record also reveals alternating wet and dry climates with periodicities of 24 and 100. kyr that were likely controlled by orbital forcing.

Here we present the results of our study of material belonging to Equus eisenmannae excavated from sequential 'lower' and 'upper' levels of the loess section at Longdan, China, which has been dated to ca. 2.55-1.85 Ma (early Nihewanian age). The morphological differences between fossils found in the 'upper level' and those from the 'lower level' were quantified using univariate and multivariate analyses. Quantitative variation among modern Equus is discussed in order to address issues of potential speciation events and evolutionary trends seen in the fossil material. We also discuss the evolutionary level of E. eisenmannae by comparing our sample with E. sanmeniensis. Results show that quantitative differences between fossils of E. eisenmannae from the different levels at Longdan approximate and do not exceed intraspecific variation among modern species of Equus, although the variation is smaller than in the extant species E. hemionus. Thus, no sufficient evidence of speciation within the two sequential levels could be found. However, some common evolutionary trends of modern Equus are evident in E. eisenmannae, even though E. eisenmannae is not considered the immediate ancestor of modern Equus. \u00a9 2011 by the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology.", "pid": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1513668d"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Ying Liu", "org": "School of Life Science", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151c3311"}, {"name": "Tao Deng", "org": "Lab of Biodiversity and Biogeography", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1509d907"}, {"name": "Qin-Er Yang", "org": "Key Lab of Plant Resources Conservation and Sustainable Utilization", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e15138651"}], "title": "Karyology of the genus Faberia (Cichorieae-Asteraceae) and its systematic implications", "venue": "Nordic Journal of Botany", "year": 2012, "abstract": "Faberia Hemsl., a small genus of six species in the tribe Cichorieae, Asteraceae, has been karyologically investigated for the first time.

The results suggest that all species of Anaphalis are nested with Helichrysum, showing a close relationship with a Mediterranean-Asian group of Helichrysum. Although the monophyly of Anaphalis is only weakly supported, two clades within the genus are well recognized, each consisting of two subgroups. The inferred phylogenetic relationships within Anaphalis correspond to the shape of leaf base, rather than the morphology of the capitula and phyllaries that are usually used for species delimitation and classification in the genus. All four subgroups of Anaphalis are common and diversified in the eastern Himalayas with multiple dispersals out of this region. The sole North American species of Anaphalis is best hypothesized to be the result of long-distance dispersal or overland migration via Bering land bridge from Asia. Our analyses suggest that the extant distribution of Anaphalis has most likely resulted one radiation into the eastern Himalayas followed by repeated independent dispersals and/or radiations mostly into eastern Asia but also into the western Himalayas, North America, and southeast Asia. \u00a9 2012 The Botanical Society of Japan and Springer.", "pid": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151bc985"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Wanlin Wang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Metal Matrix Composites", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150a791a"}, {"name": "Wang Zhang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Metal Matrix Composites", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151a1a36"}, {"name": "Weixin Chen", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Metal Matrix Composites", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ffe482"}, {"name": "Jiajun Gu", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Metal Matrix Composites", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151de244"}, {"name": "Qinglei Liu", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Metal Matrix Composites", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e151fd253"}, {"name": "Tao Deng", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Metal Matrix Composites", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1509d907"}, {"name": "Di Zhang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Metal Matrix Composites", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f77f40"}], "title": "Large-visual-angle microstructure inspired from quantitative design of Morpho butterflies' lamellae deviation using the FDTD/PSO method", "venue": "Optics Letters", "year": 2013, "abstract": "The wide angular range of the treelike structure in Morpho butterfly scales was investigated by finite-difference timedomain (FDTD)/particle-swarm- optimization (PSO) analysis.

Ma) of Tibet witnessed the drying of the northern Tibetan Plateau and the approach to the Pleistocene Ice Age within the background of intensifying Indian and East Asian monsoons. Yet little is known about Pliocene mammals living on the high Tibetan Plateau despite the fact that fossil mammals elsewhere constitute an important knowledge base for terrestrial environments. The late Miocene to Pleistocene Zanda Basin at the northern foothills of the Himalayas affords a welcome opportunity to evaluate the biological response to environmental change at high elevations. Abundant, well-preserved fossil mammals and fish from an 800-m continuous section of fine- to coarse-grained sediments thus open a rare window into a past biological world. For example, the discovery of an ancestral wooly rhino from Zanda Basin that was the precursor of its late Pleistocene megafaunal descendants leads to our \"out-of Tibet\" hypothesis, suggesting that the high Tibetan Plateau was a Pliocene cradle for Ice Age cold adaptations.In this paper, we document in detail the mammalian biostratigraphy, chronology, and paleozoogeography based on Zanda Basin fossil mammals. Our high-resolution biostratigraphy and biochronology offer for the first time independent constraints that both support and modify recent magnetostratigraphic correlations. Using characteristic Pliocene and Pleistocene mammals, particularly the small mammal assemblages in the lower part of the section and monodactylid Equus from the upper section, we propose a correlation to C1n to C3An.1r, with an age range of ~. 400. Ka to 6.4. Ma.Within the 800-m Zanda section, the lower 0-150. m is of latest Miocene age, spanning 6.4-5.3. Ma. Sparsely fossiliferous, the lower section has produced five taxa so far: Ochotona, Panthera, Qurliqnoria, Palaeotragus, and Hipparion-all are consistent with a late Miocene age. The middle 150-620. m section spans the entire Pliocene. This section is by far the most fossiliferous, including such typical Pliocene small mammals as Prosiphneus, Mimomys, Apodemus, and Trischizolagus, as well as large mammals such as Coelodonta thibetana, Hipparion zandaense, Chasmaporthetes, Nyctereutes, Meles, Antilospira, and others. In the upper 620-800. m section the fossils are rare, but do include characteristic Pleistocene taxa such as Equus.Zoogeographically Zanda Basin mammals are a mixture from two major sources. Taxa such as Mimomys, Prosiphneus, Trischizolagus, Chasmaporthetes, Nyctereutes, Meles, and Xenocyon are commonly found in north China or east Asia. In contrast, several forms, such as unique species of pikas (Ochotona), squirrels (Aepyosciurus), and ancestral Tibetan antelope (Qurliqnoria), seem to belong to an indigenous Tibetan fauna evolved within the plateau.

In the present study, we determined the phylogenetic position of K. heterophylla using four chloroplast DNA regions (rbcL, atpB, rps4 rps4-trnS intergenic spacer [IGS], and trnL-F IGS). A parsimony consensus tree indicated that K. heterophylla is not related to G. dareiformis, but is nested within the Leptochilus lineage of Microsoroideae. This relationship is also supported by sharing of clathrate scales on the rhizome, which is not found in G. dareiformis. Although marked morphological disparities are found between K. heterophylla and the Leptochilus lineage in terms of leaf dissection, fertile-sterile leaf differentiation, and sori arrangement, our results indicate that these characters have evolved independently several times in Polypodiaceae. \u00a9 2013 Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences.", "pid": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150e0139"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Ze-Long Nie", "org": "Key Laboratory of Biodiversity and Biogeography", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e15099229"}, {"name": "Tao Deng", "org": "Key Laboratory of Biodiversity and Biogeography", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1509d907"}, {"name": "Ying Meng", "org": "Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research at Kunming", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f772c4"}, {"name": "Hang Sun", "org": "Key Laboratory of Biodiversity and Biogeography", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f50f78"}, {"name": "Jun Wen", "org": "Department of Botany", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1507f11b"}], "title": "Post-Boreotropical dispersals explain the pantropical disjunction in Paederia (Rubiaceae)", "keywords": ["Intercontinental disjunction", "long-distance dispersal", "Paederia", "pantropical", "post-Boreotropical", "Rubiaceae"], "venue": "Annals of Botany", "year": 2013, "abstract": "Background and AimsPantropical intercontinental disjunction is a common biogeographical pattern in flowering plants exhibiting a discontinuous distribution primarily in tropical Asia, Africa and the Americas. Only a few plant groups with this pattern have been investigated at the generic level with molecular phylogenetic and biogeographical methods. Paederia (Rubiaceae) is a pantropical genus of 31 species of woody lianas, with the greatest species diversity in continental Asia and Madagascar and only two species from tropical America. The aim of this study was to reconstruct the biogeographical history of Paederia based on phylogenetic analyses to explore how the genus attained its pantropical distribution.MethodsMaximum parsimony and Bayesian inference were used for phylogenetic analyses using sequences of five plastid markers (the rbcL gene, rps16 intron, trnT-F region, atpB-rbcL spacer and psbA-trnH spacer). Biogeographical inferences were based on a Bayesian uncorrelated lognormal relaxed molecular clock together with both Bayesian and likelihood ancestral area reconstructions.Key ResultsThe data suggest an early diverged Asian lineage sister to the clade of the remaining species consisting of a predominantly Asian sub-clade and a primarily Malagasy sub-clade. Paederia is inferred to have originated in the Oligocene in tropical continental Asia. It then reached Africa in the early to middle Miocene, most probably via long-distance dispersal across the Indian Ocean. The two Neotropical species are inferred to have derived independently in the late Miocene from ancestors of Asia and East Africa, respectively.ConclusionsThe results demonstrate the importance of post-Boreotropical long-distance dispersals (across three major oceans) in shaping the global pantropical disjunction in some plants, such as Paederia, with small, winged diaspores adapted to long-distance dispersal by various agents including wind, ocean currents or birds. Overland migration is less likely to explain its palaeotropical disjunction between Asia and Africa. \u00a9 2013 The Author.", "pid": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150eab89"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Tao Deng", "org": "Department of Geology", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1509d907"}, {"name": "ShiQi Wang", "org": "Key Laboratory of Evolutionary Systematics of Vertebrates", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1509e64f"}, {"name": "SuKuan Hou", "org": "Key Laboratory of Evolutionary Systematics of Vertebrates", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151bf3ed"}], "title": "A bizarre tandem-horned elasmothere rhino from the Late Miocene of northwestern China and origin of the true elasmothere", "keywords": ["elasmothere", "Late Miocene", "Linxia Basin", "Rhinocerotidae", "Sinotherium"], "venue": "Chinese Science Bulletin", "year": 2013, "abstract": "Although the modern Indian and Javan rhinos have a single horn on their noses, the extinct one-horned rhino Elasmotherium was a source for the legendary unicorn, because the latter had a very long horn on its forehead and lived with the prehistoric human beings who drew its images on cave paintings. Elasmothere rhinos first appeared in South Asia in the Early Miocene, but the origin of Elasmotherium has been unclear. All other elasmotheres have a weak or strong nasal horn, whereas Elasmotherium seems to lose the nasal horn of its ancestors and to get a huge frontal horn apparently abruptly. Here we report the first discovered skull of Sinotherium lagrelii from the Late Miocene red clays in the Linxia Basin, northwestern China. This skull has an enormous nasofrontal horn boss shifted posteriorly and a smaller frontal horn boss, which are connected to each other, indicating an intermediate stage for the single frontal horn of Elasmotherium. Morphological and phylogenetic analyses confirm that Sinotherium is a transitional taxon between Elasmotherium and other elasmotheres, positioned near the root of the giant unicorn clade and originated in a subarid steppe. The posteriorly shifted nasal horn has a more substantial support and the arched structure of the nasofrontal area is an adaptation for a huge horn. \u00a9 2012 The Author(s).", "pid": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1517fe32"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Qingqing Yang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Metal Matrix Composites", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fbce27"}, {"name": "Shenmin Zhu", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Metal Matrix Composites", "id": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f67b60"}, {"name": "Wenhong Peng", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Metal Matrix Composites", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150a642d"}, {"name": "Chao Yin", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Metal Matrix Composites", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e15099c9b"}, {"name": "Wanlin Wang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Metal Matrix Composites", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150a791a"}, {"name": "Jiajun Gu", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Metal Matrix Composites", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151de244"}, {"name": "Wang Zhang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Metal Matrix Composites", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151a1a36"}, {"name": "Jun Ma", "org": "School of Engineering", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e15148894"}, {"name": "Tao Deng", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Metal Matrix Composites", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1509d907"}, {"name": "Chuanliang Feng", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Metal Matrix Composites", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150b2296"}, {"name": "Di Zhang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Metal Matrix Composites", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f77f40"}], "title": "Bioinspired fabrication of hierarchically structured, pH-tunable photonic crystals with unique transition", "keywords": ["biological templates", "functional polymer", "pH-tunable", "photonic crystals", "polymerization"], "venue": "ACS Nano", "year": 2013, "abstract": "We herein report a new class of photonic crystals with hierarchical structures, which are of color tunability over pH.

The distinctive pre-zygomatic plate and over-canine arch-niche may have played a role in protecting the skull and canines during digging. The massive masticatory muscles, reconstructed based on well-developed parietal and zygomatic crests, would have enabled the mouth to close quickly and contributed to moving the mandible both longitudinally and laterally. The configuration of the cranio-mandibular joint and its relatively high position show clearly that Chleuastochoerus was capable of both crushing and grinding movements during mastication. The comparatively simple structure of the crown surfaces of the cheek teeth suggests that the food of Chleuastochoerus may have been softer than that of extant suids. The diet of Chleuastochoerus is postulated to fall between those of true forest pigs and open habitat pigs, and the habitat of Chleuastochoerus to be relatively humid forest edge or nearby areas of open steppe. \u00a9 2013 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.", "pid": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e151fae1a"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Mohammed T.

A thermal resistance model is developed to predict the thermal performance of the thermal ground plane, including the effects of the presence of noncondensable gases. Viscous laminar flow pressure losses are predicted to determine the maximum heat load when the capillary limit is reached. This paper shows that the axial effective thermal conductivity of the thermal ground plane decreases when the substrate and/or wick are thicker and/ or with the presence of noncondensable gases. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the thermal-fluid model may be used to optimize the performance of the thermal ground plane by estimating the limits of wick thickness and vapor space thickness for a recognized internal volume of the thermal ground plane. The wick porosity plays a significant role in maximum heat transport capability. A large adverse gravitational field strongly decreases the maximum heat transport capability of the thermal ground plane. Axial effective thermal conductivity is mostly unaffected by the gravitational field. The maximum length of the thermal ground plane prior to reaching the capillary limit is inversely proportional to input power. \u00a9 2013 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.", "pid": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151efd09"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Guang-Yan Wang", "org": "University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150f6f86"}, {"name": "Ying Meng", "org": "Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research at Kunming, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f772c4"}, {"name": "Tao Deng", "org": "Key Laboratory of Biodiversity and Biogeography, Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1509d907"}, {"name": "Yong-Ping Yang", "org": "Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research at Kunming, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1508a620"}], "title": "Molecular phylogeny of Faberia (Asteraceae: Cichorieae) based on nuclear and chloroplast sequences", "keywords": ["China", "Compositae", "Faberia", "Hybridization", "Phylogeny"], "venue": "Phytotaxa", "year": 2014, "abstract": "Faberia is a perennial herbaceous member of Asteraceae that is mainly distributed in central and southwestern China.

However, the diversities in the same region of the two subtype-determinant hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) segments have received little attention. In this study, we bioinformatically analyzed all available NCRs of HA and NA vRNAs of influenza A viruses and found that nucleotides in the segment-specific NCRs of HA and NA vRNAs are subtype specific and vary significantly in sequence and length at both the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends among different subtypes. We then systematically studied the biological significance of the HA subtype-specific NCRs (HA ssNCRs) of the common HA subtypes (H1 to H7 and H9) in the context of the WSN (H1N1) reverse genetics system. We found that the HA ssNCRs play a critical role in HA vRNA virion incorporation. Upon HA vRNA incorporation, the 3\u2032-end HA ssNCR plays a more critical role than the 5\u2032-end HA ssNCR, and no stringent compatibility between the two ends is required. Furthermore, our data imply that, in addition to a particular nucleotide(s), the length of the HA ssNCR is involved in regulating HA vRNA incorporation efficiency.

In this study, we newly identified host factor DnaJA1, a member of the type I DnaJ/Hsp40 family, acting as a positive regulator for influenza virus replication. We found that DnaJA1 associates with the bPB2 and PA subunits and enhances viral RNA synthesis both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, DnaJA1 could be translocated from cytoplasm into the nucleus upon influenza virus infection. The translocation of DnaJA1 is specifically accompanied by PB1-PA nuclear import. Interestingly, we observed that the effect of DnaJA1 on viral RNA synthesis is mainly dependent on its C-terminal substratebinding domain and not on its typical J domain, while the J domain normally mediates the Hsp70-DnaJ interaction required for regulating Hsp70 ATPase activity.

The pedicle is short, cylindrical, robust, and extends posteriorly from the rear of the orbit. The anterior and posterior branches arise from the burr and diverge at an angle of 30\u00b0. The posterior branch is relatively long, and its tip is strongly curved posteriorly. The anterior branch is straight and situated anteromedially from the posterior branch. The posterior branch is lateromedially compressed, and the anterior branch has a circular cross section. The morphological observation together with a cladistic and a principal component analysis indicate that E. hezhengensis is more basal than any known species of the genus Eostyloceros in having shorter pedicles, a lower position of the fork above the burr, more slender anterior branches, and a small angle between the anterior and posterior branches.

In this work, by integrating template-based structural modeling approach with all known sequence and functional information about the PB1 protein, we constructed a modeled structure of PB1. Based on this model, we performed mutagenesis analysis for the key residues that constitute the RNA template binding and catalytic (TBC) channel in an RNP reconstitution system. The results correlated well with the model and further identified new residues of PB1 that are critical for RNA synthesis. Moreover, we derived 5 peptides from the sequence of PB1 that form the TBC channel and 4 of them can inhibit the viral RNA polymerase activity. Interestingly, we found that one of them named PB1(491-515) can inhibit influenza virus replication by disrupting viralRNApromoter binding activity of polymerase.

In this report, we present, for the first time to our knowledge, a full view of the segment-specific NCRs of all influenza A viruses by bioinformatics analysis. Our systematic functional analysis revealed that the eight segment-specific NCRs identified could differentially regulate viral RNA synthesis and protein expression at both transcription and translation levels. Interestingly, a highly conserved suboptimal nucleotide at\u201d3 position of the Kozak sequence, which downregulated protein expression at the translation level, was only present in the segment-specific NCR of PB1. By reverse genetics, we demonstrate that recombinant viruses with an optimized Kozak sequence at the\u201d3 position in PB1 resulted in a significant multiple-cycle replication reduction that was independent of PB1-F2 expression. Our detailed dynamic analysis of virus infection revealed that the mutant virus displays slightly altered dynamics from the wild-type virus on both viral RNA synthesis and protein production.

These harsh environments have served as the main driver of vertebrate evolution during the Cenozoic that produced a low productivity, low diversity, high endemicity community - environmental forcing seems to be a dominant mechanism for mammalian evolution in marginal habitats. Mammals have acquired special adaptations for thermal insulation, oxygen transport, DNA damage repair, and others. While broadly similar to faunal assemblages in North China and Central Asia, Tibetan faunas often show initiation of cold-adapted lineages that predate Ice Age megafauna. Our \"out of Tibet\" hypothesis thus postulates that cold-tolerant species in Pliocene high Tibet were pre-adapted to conditions that were to become widespread during the subsequent Pleistocene Ice Age and Tibet had thus become a cradle for Ice Age megafauna. The best examples of the \"out of Tibet\" scenario include the Tibetan woolly rhinoceros (Coelodonta thibetana), Tibetan bharal (Pseudois), Asian hunting dog (Sinicuon), and ancestral snow leopard (Panthera blytheae). Our \"Third Pole to North Pole\" linkage of an extinct Pliocene Tibetan fox, Vulpes qiuzhudingi, with the late Pleistocene and extant arctic fox, Vulpes lagopus, is a subset of the \"out of Tibet\" hypothesis. One of the iconic Tibetan mammals, the endemic Tibetan antelope (Pantholops) has the longest residence in Tibet going back to the late Miocene, suggesting a long history of perfecting its adaptations to cold environments. Stable carbon and oxygen isotope analyses of fossils from the Tibetan Plateau reveal significant spatial and temporal variations in the evolution of herbivores' diets and environments during the late Cenozoic. The diets of modern Tibetan herbivores consist primarily of C<inf>3</inf> plants, reflecting the present-day C<inf>3</inf> dominance in high-elevation cold habitats. The available carbon isotope data, however, show that warm-climate C<inf>4</inf> grasses were a significant dietary component of ancient herbivores in the Gyirong Basin (central Himalayas) in the late Miocene and in Shangri-La (southeastern Tibetan Plateau) in the Pliocene, and likely in the Qaidam Basin (NE Tibetan Plateau) from late Miocene to early Pliocene and in Kunlun Pass Basin (northeastern Tibetan Plateau) in the Pliocene. This suggests that C<inf>4</inf> grasses spread into the Tibetan Plateau in the late Miocene and had persisted in some places to early Pleistocene, but have since disappeared or become insignificant in the region. The retreat of C<inf>4</inf> grasses from the Tibetan Plateau is most likely driven by decreases in local temperatures to below the cross-over temperature unfavorable to C<inf>4</inf> grasses, as a result of tectonic uplift and/or global climate change. The available isotope data also show that high-elevation cold climatic conditions that favor C<inf>3</inf> over C<inf>4</inf> grasses arrived earlier in southwestern Tibetan Plateau than in southeastern and northeastern parts of the plateau. This would imply that the Tibetan Plateau had not uniformly reached its present height as recent as early Pleistocene. Future research should focus on determining intra-regional patterns of ecological and climatic changes in order to tease apart the effects of tectonic uplift and global climate change on local and regional environmental changes and to better understand the linkage between tectonics and climatic and biotic changes.", "pid": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e151979ad"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Qiang Li", "org": "Key Laboratory of Vertebrate Evolution and Human Origins of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15feddc8"}, {"name": "Guangpu Xie", "org": "Gansu Provincial Museum", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fc9b2b"}, {"name": "Gary T.

By modulating the wettability of such evaporation system through the control of surface chemistry, the evaporation rates are differentiated between hydrophilized and hydrophobized anodic aluminum oxide membrane-based double layered thin films.

In the system, the absorption of the incoming IR radiation by the temperature-sensitive hydrogel NPs, together with water, induces the volume change of the hydrogel NPs, similar to the volume change of the biofluid inside the sensillae receptors in M. acuminata caused by the IR radiation. This volume change results in the change of optical readout (transmittance in this study) in visible range and provides the sensitive detection of the IR radiation.

The controlled modification of butterfly wings through such subtractive process results in gradual change of the optical properties, and helps the further understanding of structural optimization through natural evolution. The brilliant color of Morpho butterfly wings is originated from the hierarchical nanostructure on the wing scales. Such nanoarchitecture has attracted a lot of research effort, including the study of its optical properties, its potential use in sensing and infrared imaging, and also the use of such structure as template for the fabrication of high-performance photocatalytic materials. The controlled subtractive processes provide a new path to modify such nanoarchitecture and its optical property. Distinct from previous studies on the optical property of the Morpho wing structure, this study provides additional experimental evidence for the origination of the optical property of the natural butterfly wing scales. The study also offers a facile approach to generate new 3D nanostructures using butterfly wings as the templates and may lead to simpler structure models for large-scale man-made structures than those offered by original butterfly wings. The subtractive modification of the Morpho butterfly wing through plasma etching results in the graduate change of 3D nanoarchitecture of the wing structure. The optical properties, including reflectance and view-angle independence, change corresponding to the structure change of the wings.

Methods: Twenty-four cases of adult choledochal cysts were detected by ERCP. Eleven cases of them with obstructive jaundice and cholangitis were treated by endoscopic naso-biliary drainage(ENBD). Results: Fourteen type I (58.3%), eight type IVa (33.3%) and two type V (Caroli's disease) (8.3%) cases were diagnosed by ERCP according to Todani's classification. Among them, there were three malignancies and four abnormal pancreatobiliary duct junction (APBDJ). The diagnostic accuracy on the extent of biliary stenosis and APBDJ by ERCP was better than that of CT and ultrasonography. Among 10 cases treated by ERCP, there were 4 choledocholithiasis, 2 biliary tract stricture, 2 cholangitis and 2 malignancies. ERCP treatment led to significant decrease in WBC, STB, ALT and ALP in one week. Conclusion: Type I cyst is the most common type of adult choledochal cysts which often presents high malignanacy and is more offen associated hepatobiliary disorders. ERCP offers more direct and accurate diagnosis on adult choledochal cyst than routine CT and ultrasonography.

METHODS: The inhibitory effect of paeonol on proliferation of HT-29 cells was detected by MTT assay. The results of apoptosis were measured by flow cytometry. Immunocytochemical staining was performed to detect the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and protein p27 in HT-29 cells treated with paeonol at different concentrations. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used for mRNA analysis. RESULTS: From the data of both MTT and flow cytometry, we observed that cell proliferation was inhibited by different concentrations of paeonol. By immunocytochemical staining, we found that HT-29 cells treated with paeonol (0.024-1.504 mmol/L) reflected reduced expression of COX-2 and increased expression of p27 in a dose-dependent manner. RT-PCR showed that paeonol down-regulated COX-2 and up-regulated p27 in a dose- and time-dependent manner in HT-29 cells. CONCLUSION: One of the apoptotic mechanisms of paeonol is down-regulation of COX-2. p27 is up-regulated simultaneously and plays an important part in controlling cell proliferation and is a crucial factor in the Fas/FasL apoptosis pathway. \u00a9 2009 The WJG Press and Baishideng.

The insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), an ubiquitin-interacting adaptor protein, serves as the key docking protein in insulin signaling. The effects of this dynamic interaction and the changes in ubiquitin expression on hepatic insulin signaling, as well as the relative therapeutic effects of Astragalus polysaccharide (APS) have not yet been elucidated. In this study, we aimed to investigate the abnormal changes which occur in the levels of IRS-1 and ubiquitin in the livers of mice (mice with insulin resistance and diabetes), and to elucidate the possible mechanisms responsible for these changes. A control group (CG), an insulin resistance group (IG) and a diabetes group (DG) were respectively composed of 12-week-old C57BL/6J mice fed a normal diet, C57BL/6J mice fed a high-fat diet and KKay mice fed a high-fat diet, and treatment groups were composed of corresponding groups treated with APS (CG + A, IG + A, DG + A). All the mice were age-matched and grouped at random. After eight weeks, the mouse models were successfully established and the related physiological or biochemical indexes were detected using corresponding methods. Ubiquitin expression in the liver was detected by immunohistochemisty, and western blot analysis was used to detect the expression of IRS-1 and ubiquitin. The results revealed that the expression of IRS-1 in the DG was significantly lower compared to that in the CG and IG; however, the nuclear expression of ubiquitin and the ubiquitination levels of IRS-1, including body weight and blood glucose and triglyceride levels in the DG were significantly higher compared to those in the CG or IG (P<0.05). There was a significant improvement in the ubiquitination levels in DG + A, including the blood glucose and triglyceride levels compared with the DG (P<0.05). From the stage of insulin resistance to the stage of diabetes, the reduced expression of IRS-1 and its enhanced ubiquitination levels combined with the overexpression of nuclear ubiquitin contributed to the abnormal glycometabolism and the disruption of insulin signaling.

However, there is currently no consensus regarding the optimal strategy. We performed a meta-analysis to compare the efficacy and safety of endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) or modified EMR (m-EMR) versus endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for the treatment of rectal carcinoid tumors. Materials and Methods: PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, Embase and CNKI were searched up to the end of January 2014 in order to identify all studies on the effects of EMR (or m-EMR) and ESD on rectal carcinoid tumors. Results: A total of fourteen studies involving 782 patients were included. The pooled data suggested a significantly higher rate of pathological complete resection among patients treated with ESD or m-EMR than those treated with EMR [odds ratio (OR)=0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.25\u20120.71; OR=0.10, 95% CI: 0.03\u20120.33, respectively], while there was no significant difference between the m-EMR group and ESD group (OR=1.19, 95% CI: 0.49\u20122.86); The procedure time of ESD was longer than EMR or m-EMR groups [mean differences (MD)=-11.29, 95% CI:-14.19 \u2012-8.38, MD=-10.90, 95% CI:-18.69 \u2012-3.11, respectively], but it was insignificance between the EMR and m-EMR groups. No significant differences were detected among the treatment groups with regard to complications or recurrence. Conclusion: The results of this meta-analysis suggest that treatment of rectal carcinoid tumors with ESD or m-EMR is superior to EMR, and the efficacy of m-EMR is equivalence to ESD treatment.

But it is difficult to select the representative locations from the whole water distribution networks because of the dynamical hydraulic status in the water distribution networks. The Lagrange method was used to analysis the water dynamic quality path of every node in every water quality time step during the water quality simulation in the networks. An objective function based on the node demand factors and the water dynamic quality path was represented to evaluate the water quality importance of each node in every water quality time step. So the optimal nodes that adapted to be fixed the sensors were selected from the networks. Fast Fourier Transformation and convolution method were used to analysis the signals collected by the water quality on-line sensors. The contamination source can be traced because the sensors impulse reaction matrix can be defined by the water dynamic path analysis. Dynamic water qualify path was calculated out in an example water distribution networks. The optimal water quality sensors' locations were defined by the water quality path calculation and the contamination sources were distinguished in a hypothetical condition through the sensors' signals analysis. It shows that the water dynamic path analysis based on the dynamic node percent information is a useful tool to optimize the water quality sensors locations and the contamination source identification.

The modeling analysis was performed to optimize the system and the materials of prism and chip, looking for the optimal incident wavelength and angle of incidence for dynamic SPRi detection in solution. The system can dynamically monitor 25 tunnels of biomolecule interactions in solution without secondary tag reactants. In addition, this system can determine the specific profile of antibody-polypeptide binding in each tunnel and yield a visual three-dimensional histogram of dynamic combinations in all microarray tunnels. Furthermore, the detection limit of the label-free antibody-polypeptide binding reached 1 pg/\u03bcL in a one-step binding test, and an ultrasensitive detection of 10 fg/\u03bcL was obtained using three-step cascade binding.

Under too strong PPOF levels, the PS disappears. \u00a9 2013 IEEE.", "pid": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15032ee5"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Deyong Chen", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Transducer Technology", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1506bdfe"}, {"name": "Guangbei Li", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Transducer Technology", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e15054e03"}, {"name": "Junbo Wang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Transducer Technology", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f9e199"}, {"name": "Jian Chen", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Transducer Technology", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fa1a1b"}, {"name": "Wentao He", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Transducer Technology", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f9a51b"}, {"name": "Yunjie Fan", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Transducer Technology", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f8cf64"}, {"name": "Tao Deng", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Transducer Technology", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e15207054"}, {"name": "Peng Wang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Transducer Technology", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1516232b"}], "title": "A micro electrochemical seismic sensor based on MEMS technologies", "keywords": ["Electrochemical approach", "Liquid proof mass", "MEMS", "Planar electrode", "Seismic sensor"], "venue": "Sensors and Actuators, A: Physical", "year": 2013, "abstract": "This paper presents the first-of-its-kind electrochemical seismic sensor where, a liquid proof mass (e.g., electrolyte solution) was used as the sensing element to translate environmental vibrations into active ion imbalances between electrodes, and therefore producing electrical current outputs. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations were conducted to confirm the feasibility of the device concept and the proposed micro seismic sensor was fabricated by conventional MEMS technologies. Device characterization based on a vibration table recorded a linear relationship between applied velocities and output voltage amplitudes with a calculated sensitivity of 274 V/(m/s) (20-80 Hz). The performance of the proposed micro device was compared with a commercially available macro counterpart (MET2003), indicating strong correlations of these two types of devices in response to random vibrations while the proposed micro seismic sensor was capable of producing a lower power spectrum compared to MET2003. In summary, the electrochemical micro seismic sensor developed in this study is featured with mass fabrication capabilities due to MEMS technologies, comparable performance and lower power spectrum compared to conventional electrochemical seismometers. This newly developed micro sensor can be potentially used in the field of seismology, enabling the ground motion monitoring to locate earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and other seismic sources. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.", "pid": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f5ee1c"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Tao Deng", "org": "Tsinghua University, Institute of Microelectronics", "id": "5b5433f8e1cd8e4e15207054"}, {"name": "Jian Chen", "org": "Tsinghua University, Institute of Microelectronics", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e150079d4"}, {"name": "Mengwei Li", "org": "Tsinghua University, Institute of Microelectronics", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fba126"}, {"name": "Chenxu Zhao", "org": "Tsinghua University, Institute of Microelectronics", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15ff2eaf"}, {"name": "Zewe Liu", "org": "Tsinghua University, Institute of Microelectronics", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f9ec8b"}], "title": "Direct surface nanopatterning using pyramidal silicon nanopore arrays as templates", "keywords": ["deposition", "nanocubes.", "nanopore array templates", "surface nanopatterning"], "venue": "Journal of Micro/Nanolithography, MEMS, and MOEMS", "year": 2013, "abstract": "Template-based surface nanopatterning techniques are highly efficient methods in realizing different surface nanopatterns, which are the fundamental structures of various nanodevices.

The genome of mouse ES cells is extremely unstable during in vitro culture and passage, and the expression of the imprinted genes is most likely to be affected. Whether the ES mice retain or repair the abnormalities of the donor ES cells has still to be determined. Here we report that the inbred ES mice were efficiently produced with the inbred ES cell line (SCR012). The ES fetuses grew more slowly before day 17.5 after mating, but had an excessive growth from day 17.5 to birth. Five imprinted genes examined (H19, Igf2, Igf2r, Peg1, Peg3) were expressed abnormally in ES fetuses. Most remarkably, the expression of H19 was dramatically repressed in the ES fetuses through the embryo developmental stage, and this repression was associated with abnormal biallelic methylation of the H19 upstream region. The altered methylation pattern of H19 was further demonstrated to have arisen in the donor ES cells and persisted on in vivo differentiation to the fetal stage. These results indicate that the ES fetuses did retain the epigenetic alterations in imprinted genes from the donor ES cells. \u00a9 2007 The Authors.", "pid": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1518f977"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Ying Kuang", "org": "Shanghai Nan Fang Model Organism Research Center", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151c8e24"}, {"name": "Xia Sun", "org": "Shanghai Nan Fang Model Organism Research Center", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e15152309"}, {"name": "Tao Deng", "org": "Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150e07c1"}, {"name": "Xi-Bin Lu", "org": "Shanghai Nan Fang Model Organism Research Center", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fb53af"}, {"name": "Rui-Lin Sun", "org": "Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1514f856"}, {"name": "Zhu-Gang Wang", "org": "Department of Medical Genetics", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e15059c2f"}, {"name": "Jian Fei", "org": "School of Life Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151f2923"}], "title": "Production and application of mice completely derived from inbred ES cell lines", "keywords": ["ES mice", "Gene targeting", "Inbred ES cell", "Tetraploid embryo complementation"], "venue": "Progress in Biochemistry and Biophysics", "year": 2008, "abstract": "The standard protocol for generating mutant mice from heterozygous targeted ES cells currently is time-consuming and needs two breeding steps and, in some cases, risks the failure of germline transmission. In contrast, the tetraploid embryo complementation is a time-saving single step procedure escaping from the chimera mouse. Hybrid ES cell lines always have higher generation frequency because of their genetic heterozygosities, which also limit their application. However, inbred ES cell lines often fail to generate ES mice. Judged by microsatellite DNA marker analysis, the completely ES cell derived mice (ES mice) were efficiently produced with two inbred ES cell lines (SCR012 and CJ7) by microinjecting the ES cells into tetraploid blastocysts generated by electrofusion. As a result, after electrofusion, about (93.01\u00b11.37)% of 2-cell stage embryos fused and (82.49\u00b1 2.08)% of them developed to blastocysts after 48 h in vitro culture. The efficiency of generating newborn ES mice of wild type SCR012 cells was higher (8.3%) than that of CJ7 (2.7%). In the meanwhile, adult and fertile mutant ES mice with two gene knock-out ES cells-18 KO (derived from CJ7) and F8 KO (derived from SCR012) were generated. Interestingly, the generation frequency of 18 KO ES mice was even higher (8.1%) than wild-type CJ7 ES mice, indicating that the development potential among ES cell clones was significantly different from each other and the decline of development potential was not equal among ES cell clones during ES cell passage in vitro culture. The F8 KO mice had indistinguishable bleeding phenotype, which is identical to that of mice derived from breeding of chimeric mice. These results suggested that this technique can be used as a powerful approach to produced gene targeted mice efficiently.", "pid": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e1507299b"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Tao Deng", "org": "Graduate School", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150e07c1"}, {"name": "Ying Kuang", "org": "Shanghai Nan Fang Model Organism Research Center", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151c8e24"}, {"name": "Long Wang", "org": "Shanghai Nan Fang Model Organism Research Center", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15013d1d"}, {"name": "Jiang Li", "org": "Shanghai Nan Fang Model Organism Research Center", "id": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e15063ef7"}, {"name": "Zhugang Wang", "org": "School of Medicine", "id": "5b5433ebe1cd8e4e15059c2f"}, {"name": "Jian Fei", "org": "School of Life Science and Technology", "id": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151f2923"}], "title": "An essential role for DNA methyltransferase 3a in melanoma tumorigenesis", "keywords": ["DNA methylation", "Dnmt3a", "Immune escape", "Melanoma", "Metastasis", "Tumorigenesis"], "venue": "Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications", "year": 2009, "abstract": "Abnormal DNA methylation and associated silencing of tumor suppressor genes are common to many types of cancers. Among the three coordinate DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts), Dnmt1 and Dnmt3b were both shown to be important for cancer cell survival and tumorigenesis. However, the relationship between Dnmt3a and tumorigenesis is still largely unknown. Here, we show that inhibition of Dnmt3a expression, by stable transfection of a Dnmt3a-RNA interference (RNAi) construct dramatically inhibited melanoma growth and metastasis in mouse melanoma models. Microarray analysis revealed that genes critical for the tumor immune response, were implicated in the inhibition of melanoma growth. Expression of a cluster of class I and class II MHC genes, class II transactivator (Ciita), as well as a subset of 5 chemokines (Cxcl9, Cxcl16, Ccl12, Ccl4, and Ccl2) were up-regulated. Furthermore, we determined that the promoter IV of Ciita was significantly demethylated in Dnmt3a-depleted tumors. In addition, several known tumor-related genes, which are critical for developmental processes and cell cycle, were confirmed to be misregulated, including TgfB1, Socs1, Socs2, E2F6, Ccne1, and Cyr61. The results presented in this report strongly suggest that Dnmt3a plays an essential role in melanoma tumorigenesis, and that the underlying mechanisms include the modulation of the tumor immune response, as well as other processes. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Inc.

A method for calibrating the instruments is described and the AOD results are analyzed. The MODIS AOD products from NASA are compared against retrieved AOD from the sun-photometers. The results reveal that the data filtered by the iterative method is more reasonable for the Langley plot than that from other approaches. Some statistical results are as follows: AOD is largest in spring, followed by autumn and summer and smallest in winter over the PRD region. The seasonal trends of AOD are consistent for the four observation sites. The annual mean regional AOD is greater than 0.7, indicating that the aerosol can attenuate direct visible radiation by 50%-60%, resulting in severely hazy weather. And AOD mainly stays between 0.4 and 0.6 in terms of frequency distribution. The \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m wavelength exponent for the four observation sites occupies high proportions between 1.2 and 1.6 with similar frequency distributions. Therefore the regional average effective radii of aerosol particles are small and also consistent and can be classified as urban-industrial aerosols. There is no significant relationship between the \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m wavelength exponent and AOD. Through sample statistics and typical case analyses, it can be concluded that the type, size distribution and effective radius of aerosol particles do not change dramatically whether the day is clear or polluted, but the number density of particles is responsible for the different effects on light extinction.

We analyze the impact of the boundary layer structure evolution on the distribution of aerosol extinction coefficient profile, based on the aerosol extinction coefficient and depolarization ratio retrievals. Results show that aerosol particles mainly concentrate below 1.5 km in this event. The haze layer mostly extends to 1km and up to 1.5 km in the afternoon under moderate haze condition, but only up to 500 m under severe haze condition. During clean days, the aerosol extinction coefficient decreases linearly with height, and the scale height at the altitude of 1490 m. In contrast, it decreases exponentially and the scale height maximizes at the altitude of 789.5 m during haze days. The evolution of boundary layer is well represented by the change of aerosol extinction coefficient profile. The aerosol extinction coefficient peaks at the top of the residual layer.

For a long slope pipeline, a severe rupture occurred in the vicinity of a drainage pipe during a segmental pigging process. In contrast to earlier accidents induced by hydraulic transients, the unique combination of topography and geometry of the drainage pipe was a key factor. Generally, a pipeline profile complexity has a significant effect on both the liquid-fill flow behavior and the state of trapped air, both of which are factors contributing to cavitation and water hammer. Pigging is a common technological process that has been studied for many years, but has rarely been analyzed by hydraulic transient methods with consideration for pig motion in a pipeline. From local data, it is shown that transient pig motion has a huge influence on operating conditions, especially outlet pressure. The purpose of this study was to identify the damage mechanism. Following extensive study, it was determined that cavitation and vapor cavity collapse cause instantaneous overpressure due to the interaction of topography, geometry of the drainage pipe, and pig motion. It would be rather difficult to simulate the pig motion by a conventional MOC and the simple water hammer equation for the collapse of large vapor cavities at a high point. Therefore, a new approach which describes the moving boundary with a dual-grid model has been implemented, along with an explicit solution procedure.

The unconventional natural gas reserves has reached 36.81\u22171012 m3. The Qinshui Basin in Shanxi Province is the largest gas field among CBM gas fields in China which are commercially exploited since the year 2003. In order to solve some typical problems in CBM production, this article considered the geographical characteristics of the fields, introduced and analyzed the low pressure gathering and transporting process and facilities, as well as the important techniques. Respectively, this article introduced the surface gathering and transporting procedure, analyzed the characteristics and topological structure; it also proposed the optimization scheme of combining steel pipes with PE pipes in processing system. The gathering and transporting processes of remote areas should be flexible and able to solve the problems during gas recovery from both largely exploited CBM blocks and remote blocks with low production. Thus a more reasonable system design should be proposed. To carry out the scheme, it first defined the topological structure of the system with graph theory, then established the economic model of the combined scheme. The article calculated the critical length of pipeline between two methods and defined the concept of remote well area. With the analysis of the actual conditions in a certain block in Qinshui Shanxi, the conclusion shows that: the scheme of laying pipelines can make more profit, which is consistent with the actual field situation., At the same time, we chose a phased optimization method, which divided the optimization of entire system into several sub-problems, including well group division, nodes connection relationship, determination of plant's optimal position, and optimization of pipe diameter. Then we established optimization model that takes the investment costs of each stage as objective functions. The example shows that compared with the artificial design result, the total length of pipeline was reduced by 4.576 km, pipeline investment by 7.35\u00d7104 US$, with the respective rates of returns of 19.57% and 4.89%. The number of valve sets in the system fell from 16 to 11 (31%). By analyzing the investment and construction scale of the existing pipe network and optimal pipe network we have proved that the method has an ideal optimization effect.

PIG is most effective when it runs at a near constant speed. The appearance of a vapor region may dramatically affect the PIG motion and ultimately contribute to impulse pressures at the end of pigging process. Large pressures may cause the PIG to run at extremely high speed, which is a highly dangerous situation. Further, the pigging efficiency can be compromised. The proposed model for estimating the pig dynamics takes into account vaporization. The basic equations governing the conservation of mass and momentum for the gas and liquid fluids were solved together with the momentum equations for the pig by applying the method of characteristics. Moreover, the new pigging model takes advantage of discrete-vapor-cavity model to predict the vaporization and location of vapor region. Numerical simulation results for gas-liquid pipeline pigging process are in good agreement with field data to validate the model developed.

The rational determination of the pipe network structure and pipelines trend is an important part of the gathering system design. The previous optimization of tree structure is usually studied under two dimensions and the distances between stations, which are represented by straight lines. The study can neither correctly reflect the real situation nor get the optimal solution, because of the dramatic topographic. This paper firstly deals with the shortest route issue on a curved surface. The common way to solve the problem is variational method. However, the method relies on the surface function, which becomes the constraints hard to deal with. The author would obtain the optimal route between two points with the genetic algorithm. Both steady state (SS) and generational (GN) GAs were implemented for the test problem. The performance of a GA generally depends on the selected GA parameters, in particular the crossover and mutation probabilities. Based on the variation of crossover and mutation probability CP and MP in the range of 0.4-1.0 and 0.0005-0.3, the sensitivity of GA to the Gas was therefore established. The best solution has been found by GN GA based on the average evaluation value of the best solutions, which obtained from fifty independent GA runs. According to the case analysis, a 21.73% reduction in total length of the pipeline has been found by using GA. The results presented show that the GA is a robust and stable technique for the solution of route optimization problem. According to further study, the practice of engineering designs are often carried out under two dimensions by using minimum spanning tree algorithm to realize the layout optimization of pipe network. On a curved surface, with the GA above, one can get the trends of each pipe section without changing the connection relationship and the total length of the network is reduced by 12.21%. Yet the connection within a plane cannot guarantee the optimum solution, thus the paper developed the optimization model of branch structure distribution within a curved surface. According to the case analysis, the previous connection relationship between points has been changed, further reducing the total length by 0.97%. In conclusion, the technique in this paper can determine the optimal pipeline laying route, effectively develop the network structure and reduce the total length of pipelines.", "pid": "5b5433f7e1cd8e4e151e710f"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Wei Ding", "org": "Key Laboratory of Earthquake Geodesy", "id": "5b5433e3e1cd8e4e15f4135d"}, {"name": "Chenwang Liao", "org": "Key Laboratory of Earthquake Geodesy", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1512dfe5"}, {"name": "Tao Deng", "org": "Key Laboratory of Earthquake Geodesy", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1515b61e"}, {"name": "Hao Wang", "org": "Key Laboratory of Earthquake Geodesy", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1517aca2"}], "title": "Application of FIFO in seismic high-speed data acquisition systems on DSP", "keywords": ["DSP", "FIFO", "High speed data acquisition", "Real-time transmission"], "venue": "Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)", "year": 2012, "abstract": "High speed data acquisitions based on TMS320C6000s are widely used in various fields.

With the more rapid development of new spacecrafts, the servo performance requirements have been much stricter and manufacturing cycle has been much shorter. Therefore, it is very necessary to develop the novel design and manufacturing tools as new alternatives to conventional ones. For electrohydraulic servo, the mechanical shell of hydraulic actuator is typically characterized by being full of complex hydraulic paths for oil flowing inside itself. However, it is very difficult to drill these oil paths in a restricted interior space of shell. Rapid prototyping and manufacturing (RPM) technology can eliminate the difficult cutting for these oil paths and a prototype of hydraulic actuator can be produced directly from its CAD model by simplifying the mechanical machining process to 2D layer adding process. This paper presents an integrated system of RPM for servo products in order to reduce substantially product development time and improve flexibility for manufacturing in small batch or various types.

Group paging is one of the candidate solutions for solving the RAN overload control problem. However, the access success probability is terrible when the group size beyond a certain threshold, thus need to seek for a new feasible solution to surmount the weakness of the group paging scheme. A pre-backoff based random access (PBRA) scheme for MTC was proposed to solve the overload problem effectively when large MTC devices use the traditional random access (TRA) scheme. In the PBRA scheme, some random access requests are uniformly distributed over a pre-backoff window. PBRA scheme can abate the number of MTC devices sending random access requests for a short time and thus can deal with the RAN congestion problem. A simulation manifests that the PBRA scheme is superior to the TRA scheme for group paging scenario in access success probability, average number of preamble transmissions and average access delay of the group paging with various combinations of group size and pre-backoff value. \u00a9 2014 IEEE.", "pid": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e15177510"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Tao Deng", "org": "School of Information Science and Technology, Southwest Jiaotong University", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fa6093"}, {"name": "Xian Wang", "org": "School of Information Science and Technology, Southwest Jiaotong University", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1518ab7f"}, {"name": "Wei Jiang", "org": "School of Information Science and Technology, Southwest Jiaotong University", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e15198e67"}], "title": "A random access scheme based on device-to-device communications for machine-type communications", "keywords": ["device-to-device", "group paging", "machine-type communications", "small data transmissions"], "venue": "International Conference on Communication Technology Proceedings, ICCT", "year": 2013, "abstract": "Machine-type communication (MTC) that usually involves a huge number of devices performing small data transmissions introduces serious challenges for mobile communication networks. Through aggregating MTC devices with identical or similar traffic characteristics into a paging group and paging the devices in the group simultaneously by a single paging, group paging can largely reduce the paging traffic caused by the traditional one-by-one paging. Despite this advantage, group paging cannot tackle the problem of overload in the random access network (RAN), when during a short period a large number of devices in a paging group contend for the random access channel (RACH) to transmit their data after receiving a group paging. This paper proposes an improved random access scheme (I-RA scheme) exploring device-to-device (D2D) communications that may be supported in 4G networks, for MTC to address the above problem. Under the I-RA scheme, a MTC device in a paging group transmits its data either directly to a base station or through the relay of a cluster head, which serves as the communication gateway for the cluster that the device belongs to. The I-RA scheme partitions a paging interval into three periods. In the first period, devices that do not join any cluster contend for the RACH to transmit their data; and at the same time the cluster heads of different clusters poll their member devices to gather data. The second period is reserved solely for the cluster heads to transmit their gathered data. The third period is for the devices that failed in the first and the second period. The I-RA scheme can decrease the number of devices that perform direct random access (D-RA) and thus can deal with the RAN overload problem. A simulation shows that the I-RA scheme outshines the traditional D-RA scheme in successful access probability, access delay and RACH utilization. \u00a9 2013 IEEE.", "pid": "5b5433ece1cd8e4e15068651"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Tao Deng", "org": "School of Information Science and Technolgy, Southwest Jiaotong University", "id": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15fa6093"}, {"name": "Xian Wang", "org": "School of Information Science and Technolgy, Southwest Jiaotong University", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1518ab7f"}], "title": "Performance Analysis of a Device-to-Device Communication-Based Random Access Scheme for Machine-Type Communications", "keywords": ["Cluster communication", "Device-to-device communications", "Group paging", "Machine type communications", "Random access"], "venue": "Wireless Personal Communications", "year": 2015, "abstract": "Group paging was proposed by the 3rd generation partnership project to reduce the awesome paging overhead in machine-type communication (MTC) that usually involves a huge number of devices performing small data transmissions.

The results show that there is high habitat heterogeneity in this region, and water content, pH value and mineral element content in soil of different micro-habitats all have difference. In which, soil water content in waterfall habitat is the highest (51. 9%) and that in drought cliff habitat is the lowest (only 13. 0%); the soil of Al, Ba, Cd, Co, Cu, K, Mg, Mn, Se and Zn in soil have obvious differences among nine micro-habitats, in which, Al content is the highest.

However, because of the low SNR and undulating background, the infrared moving small target detection is a difficult problem in a long time. To solve this problem, a novel spatial-temporal detection method based on bi-dimensional empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and time-domain difference is proposed in this paper. This method is downright self-data decomposition and do not rely on any transition kernel function, so it has a strong adaptive capacity. Firstly, we generalized the 1D EMD algorithm to the 2D case. In this process, the project has solved serial issues in 2D EMD, such as large amount of data operations, define and identify extrema in 2D case, and two-dimensional signal boundary corrosion. The EMD algorithm studied in this project can be well adapted to the automatic detection of small targets under low SNR and complex background. Secondly, considering the characteristics of moving target, we proposed an improved filtering method based on three-frame difference on basis of the original difference filtering in time-domain, which greatly improves the ability of anti-jamming algorithm. Finally, we proposed a new time-space fusion method based on a combined processing of 2D EMD and improved time-domain differential filtering. And, experimental results show that this method works well in infrared small moving target detection under low SNR and complex background. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Based on the experiment and simulation results, these findings demonstrate that the enhanced infrared absorption over a broad spectral range is due to the mechanism that the plasmon and the coherent coupling between adjacent resonance systems integrate with the HSAS.", "pid": "5b5433e6e1cd8e4e15f90d1e"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Jianjun Chen", "org": "State Key Lab of Metal Matrix Composites, Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150cf43c"}, {"name": "Huilan Su", "org": "State Key Lab of Metal Matrix Composites, Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15feb525"}, {"name": "Tao Deng", "org": "State Key Lab of Metal Matrix Composites, Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "id": "5b5433f6e1cd8e4e151db75c"}, {"name": "Wang Zhang", "org": "State Key Lab of Metal Matrix Composites, Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "id": "5b5433f5e1cd8e4e151a1a36"}, {"name": "Woon-Ming Lau", "org": "Chengdu Green Energy and Green Manufacturing Technology R and D Center", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fb6207"}, {"name": "Di Zhang", "org": "State Key Lab of Metal Matrix Composites, Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f77f40"}], "title": "Bioinspired Au/N-TiO<inf>2</inf> photocatalyst templated from Zea Mays Linn. leaves", "keywords": ["Bioinspired", "Hierarchical", "Hybrid materials and structures"], "venue": "Bioinspired, Biomimetic and Nanobiomaterials", "year": 2014, "abstract": "The leaves of Zea mays Linn. contain abundant nitrogen source and exhibit an extremely high light-harvesting efficiency due to its hierarchical internal structures.

According to recent paleontological research, amebelodontines were predominant proboscideans in faunas of the early to middle Miocene of East Asia. In addition to the abundant Platybelodon, other amebelodontines are known, but they have been largely neglected by researchers. Here we describe two species of Protanancus, Pr. tobieni and Pr. brevirostris, sp. nov., from China. The former was present during the middle Miocene in Tongxin and Qin'an and was previously attributed to Amebelodon or Serbelodon; the latter was present during the early Miocene in the Linxia Basin. Cladistic analysis indicates that the two species appear to represent primitive members of Protanancus. However, the phylogenetic relationship among Protanancus, Platybelodon, and Amebelodon remains unresolved because of their strong parallel evolution. Our study suggests intensive competition between Protanancus and Platybelodon based on similarities in their mandibular morphologies and dental microwear patterns, with the former genus disappearing from East Asia by the late middle Miocene. This scenario is supported by a mechanical model, in which lower tusks with dentinal tubules, as occur in Platybelodon, show greater resistance to the adverse effects of both a heavy load and abrasion than those with concentric laminae, present in Protanancus. The model aids in interpreting the evolution of the inner structure of the lower tusks of amebelodontines, which may have provided a competitive advantages for these species.", "pid": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e1513a914"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Zhiheng Li", "org": "Department of Geological Sciences, Jackson School of Geosciences, University of Texas at Austin", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e151774b1"}, {"name": "Zhonghe Zhou", "org": "Key Laboratory of Vertebrate Evolution and Human Origins, Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150a5661"}, {"name": "Tao Deng", "org": "Key Laboratory of Vertebrate Evolution and Human Origins, Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e151197bb"}, {"name": "Qiang Li", "org": "Key Laboratory of Vertebrate Evolution and Human Origins, Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150dab8e"}, {"name": "Julia A.

Previous studies have shown that primary osteoporosis is associated with gene mutations.To explore the functional modules of the PPI (protein-protein interaction) network of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and the related pathways participating in primary osteoporosis. Methods. The gene expression profile of primary osteoporosis GSE35956 was downloaded from the GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) database and included five MSC (mesenchymal stem cell) specimens of normal osseous tissue and five MSC specimens of osteoporosis. The DEGs between the two types of MSC specimens were identified by the samr package in R language. In addition, the functions and pathways of DEGs were enriched. Then the DEGs were mapped to String to acquire PPI pairs and the PPI network was constructed with by these PPI pairs. Topological properties of the network were calculated by Network Analyzer, and modules in the network were screened by Cluster ONE software. Subsequently, the fronting five modules whose P-value was less than 1.0e-05 were identified and function analysis was conducted. Results: A total of 797 genes were filtered as DEGs from these ten specimens of GSE35956 with 660 up-regulated genes and 137 down-regulated genes. Meanwhile, up-regulated DEGs were mainly enriched in functions and pathways related to cell cycle and DNA replication. Furthermore, there were 4,135 PPI pairs and 377 nodes in the PPI network. Four modules were enriched in different pathways, including cell cycle and DNA replication pathway in module 2. Conclusions: In this paper, we explored the genes and pathways involved in primary osteoporosis based on gene expression profiles, and the present findings have the potential to be used clinically for the future treatment of primary osteoporosis. \u00a9 2014 Li et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "pid": "5b5433e4e1cd8e4e15f59818"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Gai-Li Li", "org": "Department of Geriatrics, Chengdu Military General Hospital", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1515eba5"}, {"name": "Xian-Hua Xu", "org": "Department of Geriatrics, Chengdu Military General Hospital", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1515bedf"}, {"name": "Bing-Ang Wang", "org": "Department of Orthopedics, 452 Hospital of the People's Liberation Army", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150e83ca"}, {"name": "Yi-Min Yao", "org": "Department of Orthopedics, 452 Hospital of the People's Liberation Army", "id": "5b5433f2e1cd8e4e15139153"}, {"name": "Yang Qin", "org": "Department of Geriatrics, Chengdu Military General Hospital", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e15197e3a"}, {"name": "Shu-Rong Bai", "org": "Department of Geriatrics, Chengdu Military General Hospital", "id": "5b5433efe1cd8e4e150d4262"}, {"name": "Jian Rong", "org": "Department of Geriatrics, Chengdu Military General Hospital", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e15083121"}, {"name": "Tao Deng", "org": "Department of Geriatrics, Chengdu Military General Hospital", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1510c8a9"}, {"name": "Yong-He Hu", "org": "Department of Geriatrics, Chengdu Military General Hospital", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150eb54e"}], "title": "Erratum: Analysis of protein-protein interaction network and functional modules on primary osteoporosis (European Journal of Medical Research (2014) 19 (15))", "venue": "European Journal of Medical Research", "year": 2015, "pid": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fef071"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Zhen-Li Zhou", "org": "School of Physical Science and Technology, Southwest University", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15faff6a"}, {"name": "Guang-Qiong Xia", "org": "School of Physical Science and Technology, Southwest University", "id": "5b5433eee1cd8e4e150b959a"}, {"name": "Tao Deng", "org": "School of Physical Science and Technology, Southwest University", "id": "5b5433e7e1cd8e4e15fc9a40"}, {"name": "Mao-Rong Zhao", "org": "School of Physical Science and Technology, Southwest University", "id": "5b5433e9e1cd8e4e15005383"}, {"name": "Zheng-Mao Wu", "org": "School of Physical Science and Technology, Southwest University", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1511b938"}], "title": "Multiple polarization switching in mutually coupled vertical-cavity surface emitting lasers", "keywords": ["Mutual coupling", "Polarization switching", "Vertical-cavity surface emitting lasers"], "venue": "Wuli Xuebao/Acta Physica Sinica", "year": 2015, "abstract": "Based on the spin-flip model, the characteristics of multiple polarization switching (PS) in mutually-coupled verticalcavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) are investigated by continuously changing some important parameters.

It is found that the PS of the S-VCSEL subjected to parallel or orthogonal optical injection undergoes a change of periodic oscillation with the applied transverse electric field. The envelope trajectory of the oscillation peak appears to be a cosine curve, and that of the oscillation wave trough becomes a sine curve. Besides, the PS of the S-VCSEL only depends on the applied transverse electric field and the bias current of the M-VCSEL, and is independent of the bias current of the S-VCSEL. When the bias current of the M-VCSEL takes a different value, the PS of the S-VCSEL shows a different evolution law in one period of the applied electric field. For a certain fixed bias current of the M-VCSEL, the optically injected S-VCSEL can emit an arbitrary polarization mode and its NDBs experience different evolutions when the light from the M-VCSEL goes through EO intensity modulation. If the output light of the M-VCSEL is subjected to EO intensity modulation and EO phase modulation simultaneously, while the bias current of the S-VCSEL is fixed at 1.06, that of the M-VCSEL is fixed at 1.18, and the optical injection strength is set at 5 ns-1, then the output polarization of the S-VCSEL is in turn switched from the y-LP to the left-handed elliptic polarization (EP), then the right-handed EP circular polarization, and lastly the left-handed EP.

B35 neural cells exposed to OGD caused a decrease in cell viability and increases in the percentage of apoptotic cells and the level of intracellular cleaved caspase-3, all of which were markedly attenuated by DATS. Further, DATS treatment significantly increased Nrf2 expression and nuclear translocation, upregulated downstream gene HO-1 and inhibited intracellular ROS and MDA generation, all of which were markedly attenuated in cells transfected with Nrf2-specific siRNA.

The case of Meehania (Lamiaceae)", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "year": 2015, "abstract": "Despite considerable progress, many details regarding the evolution of the Arcto-Tertiary flora, including the timing, direction, and relative importance of migration routes in the evolution of woody and herbaceous taxa of the Northern Hemisphere, remain poorly understood. Meehania (Lamiaceae) comprises seven species and five subspecies of annual or perennial herbs, and is one of the few Lamiaceae genera known to have an exclusively disjunct distribution between eastern Asia and eastern North America. We analyzed the phylogeny and biogeographical history of Meehania to explore how the Arcto-Tertiary biogeographic hypothesis and two possible migration routes explain the disjunct distribution of Northern Hemisphere herbaceous plants. Parsimony and Bayesian inference were used for phylogenetic analyses based on five plastid sequences (rbcL, rps16, rpl32-trnH, psbA-trnH, and trnL-F) and two nuclear (ITS and ETS) gene regions. Divergence times and biogeographic inferences were performed using Bayesian methods as implemented in BEAST and S-DIVA, respectively. Analyses including 11 of the 12 known Meehania taxa revealed incongruence between the chloroplast and nuclear trees, particularly in the positions of Glechoma and Meehania cordata, possibly indicating allopolyploidy with chloroplast capture in the late Miocene. Based on nrDNA, Meehania is monophyletic, and the North American species M. cordata is sister to a clade containing the eastern Asian species. The divergence time between the North American M. cordata and the eastern Asian species occurred about 9.81 Mya according to the Bayesian relaxed clock methods applied to the combined nuclear data. Biogeographic analyses suggest a primary role of the Arcto-Tertiary flora in the study taxa distribution, with a northeast Asian origin of Meehania. Our results suggest an Arcto-Tertiary origin of Meehania, with its present distribution most probably being a result of vicariance and southward migrations of populations during climatic oscillations in the middle Miocene with subsequent migration into eastern North America via the Bering land bridge in the late Miocene.", "pid": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e1501ccc3"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Bin Sun", "org": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433e5e1cd8e4e15f805d4"}, {"name": "Yu-Fei Wang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Systematic and Evolutionary Botany, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433f4e1cd8e4e1517ce31"}, {"name": "Cheng-Sen Li", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Systematic and Evolutionary Botany, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433f3e1cd8e4e1515e204"}, {"name": "Jian Yang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Systematic and Evolutionary Botany, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433eae1cd8e4e15034540"}, {"name": "Jin-Feng Li", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Systematic and Evolutionary Botany, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433e8e1cd8e4e15fe85a2"}, {"name": "Ye-Liang Li", "org": "Henan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine", "id": "5b5433f1e1cd8e4e1510f235"}, {"name": "Tao Deng", "org": "Key Laboratory of Vertebrate Evolution and Human Origins, Institute of Vertebrate Palaeontology and Palaeoanthropology, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e150fb6bf"}, {"name": "Shi-Qi Wang", "org": "Key Laboratory of Vertebrate Evolution and Human Origins, Institute of Vertebrate Palaeontology and Palaeoanthropology, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433ede1cd8e4e1509e64f"}, {"name": "Min Zhao", "org": "Key Laboratory of Vertebrate Evolution and Human Origins, Institute of Vertebrate Palaeontology and Palaeoanthropology, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "id": "5b5433f0e1cd8e4e15109ab5"}, {"name": "Robert A.

The physical design involves optical interference and diffraction on the fabricated periodic nanostructures and uses optical loss in the nanostructure to enhance the spectral diversity of reflectance. The chemical design uses spatially controlled nanostructure functionalization.
